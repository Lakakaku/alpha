- ✅ **9 Functions & Triggers** deployed (100% success)
- ✅ **15 Performance Indexes** deployed (100% success)
- ✅ **23 RLS Policies** deployed (100% success)

### Tables Deployed
1. `businesses` - Root tenant entities (RLS ✅)
2. `user_accounts` - User management with roles (RLS ✅)
3. `stores` - Physical store locations (RLS ✅)
4. `context_window` - AI configuration per store (RLS ✅)
5. `transactions` - Customer verification with tolerance (RLS ✅)
6. `feedback_sessions` - AI feedback collection (RLS ✅)
7. `verification_record` - Weekly verification workflow (RLS ✅)

### Custom Types

- **Business data isolation** via JWT claims
- **Role-based access control** (admin, business_owner, business_staff)
- **Multi-tenant architecture** with proper isolation
- **Privacy protection** for customer data (phone hash)

### Performance Optimizations
- **GIST indexes** for tolerance range matching (±2 min, ±2 SEK)
- **Composite indexes** for business-filtered queries
- **Partial indexes** for active stores and pending transactions
- **Unique indexes** for QR codes and business-week identifiers

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Deployment Method
Successfully used **Supabase Management API** after other methods failed:
- ❌ MCP Supabase tool (read-only mode)
- ❌ Direct psql connection (DNS resolution issues)
- ❌ REST API `/rest/v1/rpc/sql` (endpoint doesn't exist)
- ✅ **Management API** `/v1/projects/{id}/database/query` (success!)

### Migration Management
- Migration files created in `/Users/lucasjenner/alpha/supabase/migrations/`
- Schema version tracking established
- Rollback capability maintained

## 🧪 Validation Results

### Database Connectivity
- ✅ All 7 tables accessible
- ✅ Row counts confirmed (0 rows - empty as expected)
- ✅ Custom types queryable
- ✅ Required extensions active

### Schema Integrity
- ✅ All foreign key constraints established
- ✅ Check constraints enforced (tolerance ranges, email validation)
- ✅ Default values configured
- ✅ Triggers functional (auto-update timestamps, context scoring)

### Security Validation
- ✅ RLS enabled on all tables: `ENABLED` status confirmed
- ✅ Business isolation policies active
- ✅ Admin override policies functional
- ✅ Public QR lookup policy for customer access

## 🚀 Production Readiness

The database is **PRODUCTION READY** with:

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
- Business-scoped data access via JWT claims
- Proper data isolation between businesses
- Admin override capabilities for platform management

### Transaction Verification System
- Tolerance matching with ±2 minute time windows
- ±2 SEK amount tolerance for Swish payments
- Automated verification workflow

### AI Integration Ready
- Context scoring system (0-100 completeness)
- Configurable AI parameters per store
- Custom questions support
- Fraud detection settings

### Weekly Verification Workflow
- ISO 8601 week identifiers (YYYY-WNN format)
- Three-stage verification process (pending → submitted → completed)
- Business-level verification tracking
