# TASKS.md - Project Alpha Implementation Plan

## Overview
Comprehensive task breakdown for the Vocilia customer feedback reward system. This plan prioritizes early business site development while building a robust foundation for the complete system.

### Architecture Overview
**Frontend (Vercel)**: Next.js 14 monorepo with three applications (Customer, Business, Admin)
**Backend (Railway)**: Node.js API services, webhooks, AI processing, and background jobs
**Database (Supabase)**: PostgreSQL with Row Level Security, authentication, and real-time features

This separation allows optimal deployment strategies: Vercel's edge network for fast frontend delivery and Railway's infrastructure for scalable backend services.
