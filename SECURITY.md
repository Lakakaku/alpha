## 🏷️ Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | ✅ Supported       |
| < 1.0   | ❌ Not Supported   |

## 🛡️ Security Principles

### Core Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimum necessary access rights
3. **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify
4. **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data
5. **Privacy by Design**: Privacy built into system architecture

### Security Architecture

- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with multi-factor authentication
- **Authorization**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- **Data Encryption**: At rest and in transit (TLS 1.3)
- **Network Security**: WAF and DDoS protection via Vercel
- **Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring and alerting

## 🔐 Data Protection

### Customer Data Protection

#### Personal Information
- **Phone Numbers**: Never shared with businesses during verification
- **Call Records**: Encrypted and anonymized
- **Transaction Data**: Separated from personal identifiers
- **Feedback Content**: Anonymized before business delivery

#### Data Retention
- **Low-grade Feedback**: Immediately deleted (no reward eligibility)
- **High-grade Feedback**: Summarized and stored for business analysis
- **Transaction Records**: Retained for verification cycle (1 week)
- **Customer Identifiers**: Aggregated for payment processing only

### Business Data Protection

#### Sensitive Business Information
- **POS Data**: Encrypted during transmission and storage
- **Store Configuration**: Protected by business-specific RLS policies
- **Financial Data**: Separated from operational data
- **Context Information**: Business-specific access controls

#### Access Controls
- **Business Accounts**: Single-store or multi-store permissions
- **Admin Access**: Limited to authorized personnel only
- **API Access**: Rate-limited and authenticated
- **Database Access**: RLS policies enforce data isolation

### Technical Security Measures

#### Database Security
```sql
-- Example RLS Policy for Store Data
CREATE POLICY "Businesses can only access their own stores"
ON stores FOR ALL USING (
  auth.uid() = owner_id OR
  auth.uid() IN (
    SELECT user_id FROM business_users
    WHERE business_id = stores.business_id
  )
);
```

#### API Security
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with short expiration
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-endpoint and per-user limits
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive server-side validation
- **CORS**: Restrictive CORS policies

#### Application Security
- **CSP Headers**: Content Security Policy implementation
- **XSS Protection**: Input sanitization and output encoding
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based CSRF protection
- **Secure Headers**: Security headers on all responses

## 🔧 Security Best Practices

### For Developers

#### Code Security
```typescript
// ✅ Secure input validation
import { z } from 'zod';

const phoneNumberSchema = z.string()
  .regex(/^\+46\d{9}$/, 'Invalid Swedish phone number');

// ✅ Secure database queries
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('stores')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', storeId)
  .single(); // RLS automatically enforces permissions
```

#### Environment Security
```bash
# ✅ Secure environment variables
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_key_here  # Never commit to git
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here              # Use secret management
SWISH_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=/secure/path       # Secure file permissions
```

#### Authentication Patterns
```typescript
// ✅ Secure authentication check
export async function getServerSideProps({ req }) {
  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser(req.cookies.token);

  if (!user) {
    return { redirect: { destination: '/login' } };
  }

  return { props: { user } };
}
```

### For System Administrators

#### Infrastructure Security
- **TLS Certificates**: Automated renewal and monitoring
- **Firewall Rules**: Restrictive ingress/egress rules
