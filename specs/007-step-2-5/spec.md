## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

Business managers need an intelligent assistant to help them build comprehensive
store context for their feedback system. The AI assistant guides them through a
conversational interface to gather all necessary business information, suggests
missing details, and validates the completeness of their context. This ensures
their AI-powered customer feedback calls are accurate, relevant, and effective
at preventing fraud while collecting valuable insights.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a business manager accesses the context builder, **When** they
   start a conversation with the AI assistant, **Then** the assistant asks
   targeted questions about their store type, layout, and operations to build
   comprehensive context
2. **Given** incomplete context information, **When** the AI assistant analyzes
   the current context, **Then** it identifies specific gaps and proactively
   suggests topics the manager should address
3. **Given** a completed context session, **When** the AI validates the
   information, **Then** it provides a completeness score (0-100%) and specific
   improvement recommendations
4. **Given** context information being entered, **When** the AI detects
   potential fraud detection weaknesses, **Then** it suggests additional
   baseline facts and verification thresholds to strengthen fraud prevention
5. **Given** a business manager wants to optimize their feedback questions,
   **When** they consult the AI assistant, **Then** it recommends optimal
   question frequencies and suggests new questions based on store type and
   context gaps

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the AI assistant cannot determine store type from provided
  information?
- How does the system handle contradictory information provided during the
  conversation?
- What occurs when the completeness score remains below minimum threshold after
  multiple improvement attempts?
- How does the assistant respond to inappropriate or irrelevant context
  information?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

#### Chat Interface & Conversation Management

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a conversational chat interface where business
  managers can interact with an AI assistant in natural language
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically save all conversation data and context
  information in real-time without requiring manual save actions
- **FR-003**: AI assistant MUST ask targeted, contextual questions based on the
  business manager's responses to gather comprehensive store information
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain conversation history and allow managers to
  resume previous context-building sessions

#### Context Gap Identification & Suggestions

- **FR-005**: AI assistant MUST analyze current context information and identify
  specific missing or incomplete areas
- **FR-006**: System MUST proactively suggest relevant topics for discussion
  based on store type, industry standards, and detected gaps
- **FR-007**: AI assistant MUST recommend additional context details that would
  improve fraud detection and feedback quality
- **FR-008**: System MUST highlight critical missing information that could
  compromise fraud prevention effectiveness

#### Information Extraction & Enhancement

- **FR-009**: AI assistant MUST extract structured information from natural
  language conversations and organize it into appropriate context categories
- **FR-010**: System MUST suggest missing personnel information, department
  details, and operational procedures based on store type
- **FR-011**: AI assistant MUST recommend customer journey mapping and flow
  optimization based on store layout information
- **FR-012**: System MUST identify opportunities for seasonal variations and
  special event considerations

#### Question Recommendations & Optimization

- **FR-013**: AI assistant MUST recommend custom feedback questions tailored to
  the specific store type and context
- **FR-014**: System MUST suggest optimal question frequencies to balance data
  collection needs with customer experience
- **FR-015**: AI assistant MUST propose question combinations that fit within
  the 1-2 minute call duration constraint
- **FR-016**: System MUST recommend priority levels for different question
  categories based on business goals

#### Context Validation & Scoring

- **FR-017**: System MUST calculate a context completeness score (0-100%) based
  on required and recommended information fields
- **FR-018**: AI assistant MUST provide specific, actionable improvement
  suggestions to increase completeness score
- **FR-019**: System MUST validate context information for logical consistency
  and flag potential contradictions
- **FR-020**: AI assistant MUST ensure all baseline facts necessary for fraud
  detection are properly configured

#### Fraud Detection Configuration

- **FR-021**: System MUST guide managers through setting up fraud detection
  parameters including baseline facts and verification thresholds
- **FR-022**: AI assistant MUST suggest appropriate red flag keywords and
  acceptable creativity ranges based on store context
- **FR-023**: System MUST recommend verification sensitivity levels based on
  store type and risk assessment
- **FR-024**: AI assistant MUST validate that fraud detection configuration
  covers all critical verification points

### Performance & Experience Requirements

- **FR-025**: AI assistant responses MUST be generated within response time
  target not specified - typically 2-3 seconds for chat interfaces
- **FR-026**: System MUST handle concurrent context-building sessions for
  multiple business managers without performance degradation
- **FR-027**: Context validation and scoring MUST complete within a couple of
  seconds, remember that it is better to do a well done scoring-validation than
  a stressed/half-good one.
- **FR-028**: AI assistant MUST maintain conversation context and continuity
  across browser sessions and device switches

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Context Entry**: Individual pieces of business information collected through
  conversation, including store details, operational procedures, and baseline
  facts
- **Conversation Session**: Complete chat interaction between business manager
  and AI assistant, with message history and extracted context data
- **Suggestion Record**: AI-generated recommendations for missing information,
  question optimization, and fraud detection improvements
- **Completeness Score**: Calculated metric (0-100%) representing how thoroughly
  the business context has been documented
- **Validation Result**: Assessment of context quality, consistency, and fraud
  detection readiness with specific improvement actions
