## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the Vocilia platform, I need a shared infrastructure foundation that provides consistent data access, authentication, UI components, and API functionality across all applications (customer, business, and admin) so that development is efficient, maintainable, and provides a unified user experience.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer needs to access user data, **When** they import the database client package, **Then** they receive fully typed database queries with consistent error handling
2. **Given** a user attempts to log in to any Vocilia application, **When** they provide valid credentials, **Then** they are authenticated consistently across all platforms with appropriate role-based access
3. **Given** a developer needs to build a new UI component, **When** they use the shared component library, **Then** they receive pre-built, styled components that maintain design consistency
4. **Given** a developer needs to validate user input, **When** they use the utilities package, **Then** they receive consistent validation and formatting functions
5. **Given** a backend service needs to authenticate API requests, **When** it processes incoming requests, **Then** it properly validates authentication tokens and enforces CORS policies

### Edge Cases
- What happens when authentication tokens expire during active user sessions?
- How does the system handle database connection failures in the shared client?
- How are API rate limits enforced across different applications?
- What happens when shared components need application-specific customization?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Shared Packages:**
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a database client package that offers typed database queries for all applications
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a UI component library with reusable, consistently styled base components
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a utilities package with validation, formatting, and common helper functions
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a types package with shared TypeScript definitions for data consistency

**Authentication Foundation:**
- **FR-005**: System MUST integrate with Supabase Auth for user authentication across all applications
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide authentication utilities and hooks for consistent auth state management
- **FR-007**: System MUST implement a role-based permissions system with. In the website there are 2 types of accounts, 1= business-account 2=admin-account. The business-accounts is for our customer-business which uses our feedback platform and if a business/company has multiple stores (like a foodchain) then this business just needs 1 account, and they can have different stores / track different stores' feedback, statistics etcetera. I don't know where "owner" came from, but it may be that the business-account "owns" the stores.
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide authentication middleware for secure route protection
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain user session state across application navigation

**Backend API Foundation:**
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide a backend API structure that serves all frontend applications
- **FR-011**: System MUST configure API routes with consistent request/response patterns
- **FR-012**: System MUST manage environment-specific configuration for different deployment stages
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide deployment automation for the backend infrastructure
- **FR-014**: System MUST enforce API authentication and CORS policies for secure communication
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle API errors consistently with appropriate HTTP status codes

**Integration Requirements:**
- **FR-016**: All packages MUST be compatible with the existing Vercel deployment environment
- **FR-017**: Backend services MUST be compatible with the existing Railway deployment environment
- **FR-018**: Authentication system MUST integrate with the existing Supabase project
- **FR-019**: System MUST support : what environments are needed - development, staging, production? I do not know. Do research about the project and come up with the most reasonable answer to that question.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Database Client**: Provides typed access to Supabase database with connection management and query optimization
- **UI Component**: Reusable interface elements with consistent styling and behavior patterns
- **Authentication Session**: User authentication state including tokens, permissions, and session lifecycle
- **API Route**: Backend endpoint definitions with authentication, validation, and response formatting
- **User Role**: Permission level that determines access to features and data across applications
- **Environment Configuration**: Deployment-specific settings for database connections, API keys, and feature flags
