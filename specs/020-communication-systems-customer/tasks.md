# Tasks: Communication Systems

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/020-communication-systems-customer/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   ✓ Implementation plan loaded - TypeScript/Node.js monorepo extension
   ✓ Extract: Next.js 14, Supabase, Twilio SMS, node-cron, existing structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   ✓ data-model.md: 7 entities → model tasks
   ✓ contracts/: 3 API files → contract test tasks
   ✓ research.md: Twilio, templates, compliance → setup tasks
   ✓ quickstart.md: 5 integration scenarios → integration test tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   ✓ Setup: database migration, SMS provider, dependencies
   ✓ Tests: 3 contract test files, 5 integration scenarios
   ✓ Core: 7 database models, 3 service modules, 3 API routes
   ✓ Integration: Twilio webhooks, cron jobs, RLS policies
   ✓ Polish: UI components, performance validation, monitoring
4. Apply task rules:
   ✓ Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   ✓ Same file = sequential (no [P])
   ✓ Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   ✓ All contracts have tests (notifications, support, templates)
   ✓ All entities have models (7 database entities)
   ✓ All endpoints implemented (34 endpoints total)
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```
