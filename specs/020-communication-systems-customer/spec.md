## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: What specific communication channels should be supported for customer notifications? ‚Üí A: SMS only (simple, reliable, cost-effective)
- Q: How long should the system wait before retrying failed communications? ‚Üí A: Immediate retry, then 5 minutes, then 30 minutes

- Q: What constitutes "escalating overdue notices" for late business payments? ‚Üí A: Day 1: reminder, Day 7: warning, Day 14: suspension notice

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Customers and businesses need timely, clear communication about reward payments, verification requests, and support throughout the feedback-reward cycle. Customers should know when they earn rewards and when payments are processed, while businesses need notifications about verification deadlines and invoice payments.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a customer completes feedback that earns a reward, **When** the reward is calculated, **Then** they receive an immediate SMS notification with reward amount and expected payment date
2. **Given** a weekly payment batch processes successfully, **When** payments are sent via Swish, **Then** customers receive SMS payment confirmation messages with transaction details
3. **Given** a business has pending transaction verifications, **When** the weekly verification cycle begins, **Then** they receive notification with 5 business day deadline and verification instructions
4. **Given** a business payment is overdue, **When** the deadline passes, **Then** they receive escalating reminder notifications on day 1, warning on day 7, and suspension notice on day 14
5. **Given** a customer or business needs support, **When** they contact support, **Then** they can access phone (immediate pickup), email or web chat (2 hour maximum response)
6. **Given** system processes are running, **When** status changes occur, **Then** relevant parties receive automated SMS status updates

### Edge Cases
- What happens when SMS reward notifications fail to deliver after 3 retry attempts (immediate, 5min, 30min)?
- How does system handle businesses that don't respond to verification requests within 5 business days?
- What SMS communication occurs when payment processing fails during retry cycles?
- How are support tickets escalated when response times exceed 2-hour thresholds for email/chat?
- What notifications are sent when fraud is detected during verification?
