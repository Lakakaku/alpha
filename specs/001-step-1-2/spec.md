# Feature Specification: Database Foundation for Customer Feedback System

**Feature Branch**: `001-step-1-2`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "### Step 1.2: Database Foundation
- [ ] **Task 1.2.1**: Supabase integration setup
  - Connect to existing "alpha" Supabase project (wtdckfgdcryjvbllcajq)
  - Install Supabase client libraries
  - Configure environment variables and types
  - Set up database connection utilities
- [ ] **Task 1.2.2**: Core database schema design
  - Design stores table with essential fields
  - Design businesses table with account information
  - Design feedback sessions table structure
  - Design transaction verification tables
- [ ] **Task 1.2.3**: Row Level Security (RLS) foundation
  - Create initial RLS policies for businesses
  - Set up authentication policies
  - Create store-specific data isolation policies
  - Document security model       ---- Here is some context about the whole project(but go with the tasks I just sent): '/Users/lucasjenner/alpha/VISION.md' think"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator, I need a foundational data infrastructure that securely stores and manages customer feedback data, business information, and transaction records while ensuring complete data isolation between businesses and compliance with privacy requirements.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the system is operational, **When** a business registers for the feedback service, **Then** their business account must be created with complete data isolation from other businesses
2. **Given** a business has multiple store locations, **When** they set up QR codes for each location, **Then** each store must maintain separate data storage while belonging to the same business account
3. **Given** customer feedback is collected through phone calls, **When** the data is stored, **Then** it must be linked to the correct store and transaction while maintaining customer anonymity
4. **Given** transaction verification is required, **When** comparing customer-provided data with actual transactions, **Then** the system must support time and amount tolerance matching (±2 minutes, ±2 SEK)
5. **Given** the weekly verification process occurs, **When** businesses receive transaction data for verification, **Then** customer phone numbers and feedback content must remain hidden from businesses

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a business attempts to access another business's data?
- How does the system handle concurrent feedback submissions for the same store?
- What occurs when transaction verification data contains conflicting information?
- How does the system respond to attempts to access data without proper authentication?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST create isolated data storage for each registered business
- **FR-002**: System MUST support multiple store locations per business while maintaining data separation by store
- **FR-003**: System MUST store customer feedback sessions linked to specific stores and transactions
- **FR-004**: System MUST track transaction verification data (time, amount, phone number) with tolerance matching capabilities
- **FR-005**: System MUST enforce complete data isolation between different businesses
- **FR-006**: System MUST support business user authentication and authorization
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent businesses from accessing customer phone numbers during verification process
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain data integrity during weekly verification cycles
- **FR-009**: System MUST support store-specific QR code identification and data routing
- **FR-010**: System MUST track feedback quality grading and reward calculations
- **FR-011**: System MUST support business context window storage for AI guidance
- **FR-012**: System MUST enable secure weekly data transfer between admin and business accounts
- **FR-013**: System MUST log all data access attempts for security auditing
- **FR-014**: System MUST support real-time data operations for feedback collection
- **FR-015**: System MUST maintain referential integrity across all data relationships

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Business**: Represents a company that owns one or more physical stores, contains account information, authentication credentials, and business context settings
- **Store**: Represents a physical store location belonging to a business, contains unique QR code identifier, location details, and store-specific configuration
- **Feedback Session**: Represents a customer's phone call feedback collection, linked to specific store and transaction, contains grading and reward information
- **Transaction**: Represents customer purchase verification data, contains time, amount, and verification status for matching with POS systems
- **User Account**: Represents authenticated users (business owners, admin staff), contains authentication data and permission levels
- **Verification Record**: Represents weekly verification cycle data, tracks transaction validation status and business confirmation
- **Context Window**: Represents business-specific AI guidance configuration, contains custom questions, store information, and fraud detection settings
