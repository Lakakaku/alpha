## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � COMPLETE: Business authentication and multi-store management requirements extracted
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identified: business users, authentication, dashboard, multi-store operations
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Business registration approval process not specified]
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Store ownership verification method not defined]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A business owner with one or more physical stores needs to create an account to access the customer feedback reward system. They must be able to securely log in, manage their store information, switch between multiple locations if applicable, and access store-specific feedback data while maintaining security and data isolation between different businesses.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new business owner visits the platform, **When** they create an account with valid business email and password, **Then** they receive verification instructions and can access their dashboard after verification
2. **Given** an existing business user with valid credentials, **When** they log in, **Then** they see their dashboard with company email displayed and appropriate navigation options
3. **Given** a business user forgets their password, **When** they use the password reset functionality, **Then** they receive secure reset instructions and can regain account access
4. **Given** a business owns multiple stores, **When** they log into their dashboard, **Then** they can view and switch between different store locations with appropriate permissions for each
5. **Given** a business user is logged in, **When** they select logout, **Then** their session is terminated and they are redirected to the login page
6. **Given** a business user tries to access another business's store data, **When** they attempt unauthorized access, **Then** the system denies access and maintains data isolation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a business tries to register with an email already in use?
- How does the system handle expired verification links?
- What occurs when a user tries to switch to a store they don't have permissions for?
- How does the system behave when multiple login attempts fail?
- What happens when a business account is deactivated but user tries to log in?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow business users to create new accounts using email and password
- **FR-002**: System MUST send verification emails to new business accounts before allowing dashboard access
- **FR-003**: System MUST authenticate returning users via email/password login
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide password reset functionality via email-based secure links
- **FR-005**: System MUST display the business owner's company email in the dashboard interface
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide logout functionality that terminates user sessions
- **FR-007**: System MUST support businesses with multiple store locations
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow business users to switch between their authorized stores
- **FR-009**: System MUST enforce store-specific permissions and data isolation
- **FR-010**: System MUST prevent unauthorized access to other businesses' data
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide responsive dashboard layout accessible on mobile and desktop devices
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain secure session management throughout user interactions

*Clarification needed:*
- **FR-013**: System MUST verify business legitimacy through - I think it would be great that the admin account(s) gets a notification about what accounts that want to be created, and they can varify the application.
- **FR-014**: System MUST validate store ownership via Let the admin manually do this, or do you have a better idea?

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Business Account**: Represents a business entity with email, password, verification status, and associated stores
- **Store**: Represents individual store locations with unique identifiers, addresses, and permission associations
- **Session**: Represents active user sessions with authentication state and store context
