## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
**Admin Workflow**: Every week, admin staff prepare sanitized transaction databases (transaction times and values only, no phone numbers or feedback), upload them to business portals, wait for businesses to verify against their POS systems, receive verified databases back, process payments for verified feedback, and deliver final feedback databases to businesses after payment.

**Business Workflow**: Every week, business owners receive a database with transaction times and values, cross-reference each entry against their POS system to identify legitimate vs fake transactions, mark verification status for each entry, and submit the verified database back to admin for payment processing.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new week begins, **When** admin triggers database preparation, **Then** system aggregates all feedback with transaction data, removes phone numbers and feedback content, and generates store-specific verification databases
2. **Given** verification databases are prepared, **When** admin uploads to business portals, **Then** each business receives only their store's data with clear verification instructions and deadline notifications
3. **Given** business receives verification database, **When** they cross-reference against POS system, **Then** they can mark each transaction as verified or fake and submit results back
4. **Given** business submits verified database, **When** admin processes verification results, **Then** system calculates total rewards, generates invoices (rewards + 20% fee), and tracks payment status
5. **Given** business completes payment, **When** admin confirms payment received, **Then** system delivers complete feedback database to business and processes customer reward payments via Swish

### Edge Cases
- What happens when business misses verification deadline?
- How does system handle partial verifications (some transactions unmarked)?
- What occurs if business disputes verification results?
- How are payment failures and retries managed?
- What happens when customer phone numbers are invalid for Swish payments?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Database Preparation System (Task 4.2.1)
- **FR-001**: System MUST aggregate all feedback data weekly and generate store-specific transaction databases
- **FR-002**: System MUST remove all phone numbers and feedback content from verification databases while preserving transaction times and values
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate automated exports of verification databases in format accessible to businesses
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain full audit trail of all database preparation operations

#### Verification Management (Task 4.2.2)
- **FR-005**: System MUST track verification status for each transaction (pending, verified, fake, expired)
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide business interface for uploading verification databases with clear marking capabilities
- **FR-007**: System MUST monitor verification deadlines and send automated reminders to businesses
- **FR-008**: System MUST notify businesses of upcoming deadlines via multiple channels

#### Payment Processing Interface (Task 4.2.3)
- **FR-009**: System MUST process verified feedback and calculate total reward amounts per business
- **FR-010**: System MUST generate invoices including reward totals plus 20% administrative fee
- **FR-011**: System MUST track payment status (pending, completed, failed, disputed) for each business
- **FR-012**: System MUST deliver final feedback databases to businesses only after payment confirmation
- **FR-013**: System MUST process customer reward payments via Swish aggregating all rewards per phone number weekly

### Key Entities

- **Weekly Verification Cycle**: Represents complete verification workflow from data preparation through final delivery, tracks cycle status and deadlines
- **Verification Database**: Store-specific transaction data stripped of sensitive information, tracks preparation and upload status
- **Verification Record**: Individual transaction verification status marked by business, links to original feedback data
- **Payment Invoice**: Business payment record including reward calculations and administrative fees, tracks payment status
- **Verification Deadline**: Time-bound constraints for business verification submission, includes reminder schedules
- **Customer Reward Batch**: Weekly aggregation of all rewards per phone number for consolidated Swish payments
