## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Business owners need to provide comprehensive context about their stores so the AI can ask relevant, targeted questions during customer feedback calls. This context includes everything from basic store information to specific operational details that help the AI understand what aspects of the customer experience to focus on and how to identify legitimate versus fraudulent feedback.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new business account is created, **When** the owner accesses the Context Route, **Then** they see guided forms to configure their store profile with store type, size, operating hours, and location details

2. **Given** a business has basic store information, **When** they configure personnel information, **Then** they can specify staff counts, department allocations, key personnel roles, and customer service points

3. **Given** a business wants to document their store layout, **When** they access the layout section, **Then** they can create a store map, position departments, track layout changes with dates, and document customer navigation flows

4. **Given** a business needs to specify their offerings, **When** they configure inventory and services, **Then** they can manage product categories, set up special services, select payment methods, and integrate loyalty programs

5. **Given** a business has configured their context, **When** customers provide feedback about their store, **Then** the AI uses this context to ask relevant questions and detect unrealistic suggestions

6. **Given** a business updates their store information, **When** they save changes, **Then** the system tracks these changes with timestamps and the AI immediately uses updated context for new feedback calls

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a business has multiple store locations with different layouts and operating procedures?
- How does the system handle seasonal changes in inventory or operating hours?
- What occurs when a business undergoes renovation and layout changes frequently?
- How does the system manage context for businesses with complex department structures or franchised sections?
