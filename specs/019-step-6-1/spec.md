## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25

- Q: How should the quality score (0-100) map to the reward percentage (2-15%)? ‚Üí A: Threshold-based (Below 50 ‚Üí no reward, 50-100 ‚Üí linear 2-15%)
- Q: What is the maximum number of automatic retry attempts for failed Swish payments? ‚Üí A: 3 retries (total 4 attempts including initial)
- Q: What is the minimum payout amount threshold for Swish payments? ‚Üí A: 5 SEK (hold smaller amounts until threshold met)
- Q: How should the system handle currency rounding for reward calculations? ‚Üí A: Round to nearest √∂re (0.01 SEK) using standard rounding
- Q: When should the weekly payment batch process run? ‚Üí A: Sunday midnight 00:00 (end of calendar week)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a customer who provided high-quality feedback through the AI phone call
system, I receive my earned cashback reward (2-15% of my transaction value) via
Swish once per week, aggregated across all stores where I gave feedback. The
system ensures legitimate transactions are rewarded while fraudulent feedback is
filtered out through business verification.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a customer has completed 3 verified feedback calls this week (Store
   A: 100 SEK transaction, 10% reward; Store B: 200 SEK transaction, 8% reward;
   Store C: 150 SEK transaction, 12% reward), **When** the weekly payment batch
   runs, **Then** the customer receives a single Swish payment of 44 SEK (10 +
   16 + 18 SEK combined)

2. **Given** a customer provided feedback with a quality score of 85/100,
   **When** the reward calculation runs, **Then** the system awards
   11.1% cashback (linear mapping: (85-50)/(100-50) √ó (15%-2%) + 2% = 11.1%)

3. **Given** a business verifies 20 feedback transactions and marks 3 as
   fraudulent, **When** the payment processing runs, **Then** only the 17
   verified legitimate feedbacks generate reward payments

4. **Given** a Swish payment fails due to invalid phone number, **When** the
   payment processor detects the failure, **Then** the system logs the failure,
   notifies admin, and schedules a retry with manual review

5. **Given** the admin reviews weekly payment reconciliation, **When** viewing
   the payment report, **Then** the system shows total rewards paid, admin fees
   (20% of rewards), number of successful/failed payments, and store-by-store
   breakdown

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a customer's phone number is no longer valid for Swish?
  - System marks payment as failed, holds reward for manual resolution, notifies
    admin

- What happens when aggregated weekly rewards are below 5 SEK minimum threshold?
  - System carries forward unpaid rewards to next week, continuing to accumulate
    until 5 SEK threshold is reached

- How does the system handle multiple feedback submissions from the same
  customer at the same store within one week?
  - Each verified feedback generates separate reward, all aggregated in weekly
    payment

- What if a business doesn't verify transactions by the payment deadline?
  - Unverified feedback does not generate payments, customer notification sent,
    business invoice excludes unverified transactions

- How are partial verifications handled (e.g., business verifies 10 out of 15
  submissions)?
  - Only verified transactions generate rewards, unverified feedback is marked
    as unprocessed and excluded from current payment cycle

- What happens if Swish API is unavailable during scheduled payment batch?
  - System retries payment batch automatically, logs downtime, sends admin
    notification, reschedules to next available window

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Feedback Quality Scoring

- **FR-001**: System MUST evaluate each feedback call based on legitimacy,
  depth, and usefulness criteria
- **FR-002**: System MUST assign a quality score from 0-100 for each feedback
  submission
- **FR-003**: System MUST use AI analysis (GPT-4o-mini) to detect fraudulent or
  nonsensical feedback
- **FR-004**: System MUST immediately delete low-grade feedback content (quality score below 50
  threshold) while preserving quality_score metadata for system analytics and reward calculation tracking
- **FR-005**: System MUST summarize high-grade feedback while preserving all
  information for business delivery

#### Reward Calculation

- **FR-006**: System MUST calculate reward percentage between 2-15% based on
  feedback quality score using threshold-based mapping: scores below 50 receive
  no reward, scores 50-100 map linearly to 2-15% (score 50 ‚Üí 2%, score 100 ‚Üí 15%)
- **FR-007**: System MUST apply the calculated percentage to the verified
  transaction value
- **FR-008**: System MUST calculate rewards in Swedish Kronor (SEK) with
  precision to 0.01 SEK (√∂re), using standard rounding (round half up)
- **FR-009**: System MUST aggregate all rewards per customer phone number across
  all stores for the week
- **FR-010**: System MUST include only business-verified transactions in reward
  calculations
- **FR-011**: System MUST exclude fraudulent or unverified feedback from reward
  calculations

#### Weekly Payment Processing

- **FR-012**: System MUST process payments once per week on Sunday at 00:00
  (midnight), marking the end of the calendar week (Monday-Sunday)
- **FR-013**: System MUST send a single aggregated Swish payment per customer
  per week if the total amount meets or exceeds 5 SEK minimum threshold
- **FR-014**: System MUST batch process all pending rewards for the week in a
  single operation
- **FR-015**: System MUST verify customer phone numbers are Swish-compatible
  before initiating payment
- **FR-016**: System MUST track payment status (pending, processing, successful,
  failed) for each transaction
- **FR-017**: System MUST generate invoice to business showing: total rewards +
  20% admin fee

#### Payment Verification & Tracking

- **FR-018**: System MUST confirm successful Swish payment completion for each
  transaction
- **FR-019**: System MUST detect and log payment failures with failure reason

  recipient, timestamp, status, store association
- **FR-021**: System MUST track payment attempts and retry count for failed
  payments
- **FR-022**: System MUST notify admin of payment failures requiring manual
  intervention
- **FR-023**: System MUST prevent duplicate payments for the same feedback
  submission

#### Payment Failure Handling

- **FR-024**: System MUST automatically retry failed payments up to 3 times
  (total 4 attempts including initial payment attempt)
- **FR-025**: System MUST implement exponential backoff between payment retry
  attempts
- **FR-026**: System MUST hold rewards for manual resolution after automatic
  retry limit is exceeded
- **FR-027**: System MUST provide admin interface to manually trigger payment
  retry for failed transactions
- **FR-028**: System MUST notify customers when payment cannot be completed and
  action is required

#### Reconciliation & Reporting

  rewards paid, admin fees collected, successful payment count, failed payment
  count
- **FR-030**: System MUST provide store-by-store breakdown of rewards paid per
  business
- **FR-031**: System MUST track and display payment processing costs and net
  revenue
- **FR-032**: System MUST reconcile business invoices against actual payments
  made to customers
- **FR-033**: System MUST identify discrepancies between expected and actual
  payment amounts
- **FR-034**: System MUST provide admin dashboard showing real-time payment
  processing status
- **FR-035**: System MUST generate exportable payment history reports for
  accounting purposes

#### Swish Integration Preparation

- **FR-036**: System MUST prepare data structures to interface with Swish
  payment API : Swish merchant account not yet available, prepare mock
  integration structure -- I do not have a Swish API right now.
- **FR-037**: System MUST implement payment request formatting compatible with
  Swish API specifications
- **FR-038**: System MUST handle Swish API responses and map status codes to
  internal payment states
- **FR-039**: System MUST store Swish transaction references for each payment
- **FR-040**: System MUST implement secure credential management for Swish API
  authentication : Credential storage approach pending merchant account setup --
  Find the best and most reasonable solution.
