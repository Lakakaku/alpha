# Research: System Monitoring & Analytics

**Feature**: System Monitoring & Analytics | **Branch**: 015-step-4-3 |
**Date**: 2025-09-23

## Research Questions & Findings

### Monitoring Architecture Patterns

**Decision**: Multi-layered monitoring with real-time metrics collection,
event-driven alerts, and time-series data storage

**Rationale**:

- Need real-time dashboard updates (1-minute granularity) for operational
  awareness
- Event-driven alerts prevent alert fatigue while ensuring timely notifications
- Time-series storage in Supabase supports 1-year retention requirement
  efficiently
- Aligns with existing Vocilia architecture using Supabase and Next.js

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Third-party monitoring (DataDog, NewRelic): Rejected due to cost and data
  privacy concerns
- Real-time streaming: Rejected due to complexity, 1-minute granularity
  sufficient
- File-based logging: Rejected due to scalability and query performance
  limitations

### Performance Metrics Collection Strategy

**Decision**: Middleware-based collection with background aggregation and
Supabase storage

**Rationale**:

- Express middleware can capture API response times, error rates non-intrusively
- Background aggregation prevents performance impact on user operations
- Supabase functions can handle periodic aggregation and cleanup
- Existing Railway deployment supports background processes

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Real-time streaming: Too complex for medium-sensitivity thresholds
- Database triggers: Would impact transaction performance
- External APM tools: Doesn't align with "real data only" constitutional
  requirement

### Business Intelligence Data Pipeline

**Decision**: Event-driven updates triggered by admin data uploads with cached
analytics views

**Rationale**:

- Admin upload events (verification data, fraud analysis) are natural trigger
  points
- Materialized views in Supabase provide fast query performance for analytics
- Event-driven approach prevents unnecessary compute cycles
- Supports clarified requirement: "When admins upload data"

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Real-time updates: Unnecessary complexity for BI use case
- Scheduled batch processing: Would miss immediate insights after data uploads
- Manual refresh: Poor user experience for administrators

### Alert System Implementation

**Decision**: Threshold-based alerting with multiple notification channels
(email, dashboard, SMS)

**Rationale**:

- Medium sensitivity thresholds (2% error rate, 5s response time, 80% CPU)
  balance false positives vs early detection
- Multiple channels ensure administrators receive critical alerts
- Configurable thresholds allow adaptation to changing operational needs
- Supabase Edge Functions can handle notification dispatch

**Alternatives Considered**:

- ML-based anomaly detection: Too complex for current scope, insufficient
  training data
- Fixed thresholds only: Doesn't meet configurable requirement
- Single notification channel: Risk of missed critical alerts

### Data Export Functionality

**Decision**: Server-side generation of CSV, PDF, JSON with streaming for large
datasets

**Rationale**:

- Server-side generation prevents browser memory limitations with large datasets
- Multiple formats serve different stakeholder needs (spreadsheets, reports,
  APIs)
- Streaming approach supports large analytics exports without timeout issues
- Can leverage existing Supabase query capabilities

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Client-side generation: Memory limitations with large datasets
- Single format export: Doesn't meet "maximum flexibility" requirement
- Synchronous generation: Risk of request timeouts with large data

### Database Schema Design

**Decision**: Time-series tables with partitioning and automated cleanup for
1-year retention

**Rationale**:

- Time-series design optimizes for monitoring data patterns (frequent writes,
  time-based queries)
- Table partitioning improves query performance for large datasets
- Automated cleanup via Supabase scheduled functions ensures 1-year retention
- Separate tables for metrics, errors, events prevent single table bottlenecks

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Single monitoring table: Would create performance bottlenecks
- External time-series DB: Adds infrastructure complexity
- Manual data cleanup: Risk of storage bloat and performance degradation

### Authentication and Authorization

**Decision**: Extend existing admin authentication with monitoring-specific
permissions

**Rationale**:

- Leverages existing admin account infrastructure and RLS policies
- Monitoring-specific permissions provide granular access control
- Audit logging builds on existing admin activity tracking
- Maintains consistency with established security patterns

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Separate monitoring auth system: Would fragment user management
- All-admin access: Too broad, violates principle of least privilege
- Service-based auth: Doesn't align with admin user requirement

## Technology Stack Validation

### Existing Dependencies Confirmed

- **Next.js 14**: Supports admin dashboard extensions with app router
- **Supabase**: Handles time-series data, RLS policies, real-time subscriptions
- **Tailwind CSS**: UI consistency with existing admin components
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing for monitoring data structures

### Additional Dependencies Required

- **Chart.js/Recharts**: For dashboard visualizations (aligns with React
  ecosystem)
- **jsPDF**: For PDF report generation (widely used, well-maintained)
- **papaparse**: For CSV export functionality (standard CSV library)
- **date-fns**: For time-series date manipulations (already used in project)

### Performance Validation

- **Dashboard Load Target**: <2s achievable with materialized views and
  efficient React components
- **API Response Target**: <500ms supported by Supabase query performance
- **Analytics Query Target**: <1s achievable with proper indexing and
  aggregation

## Integration Points

### Existing System Integration

- **Admin Authentication**: Extends existing admin session management
- **Database Models**: Builds on existing packages/database structure
- **API Patterns**: Follows established backend routing conventions
- **UI Components**: Reuses existing packages/ui components and design system

### External Dependencies

- **Railway Deployment**: Backend monitoring services deploy to existing
  infrastructure
- **Vercel Deployment**: Admin frontend extensions deploy with existing app
- **Supabase Database**: All monitoring data stored in existing database with
  RLS

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

- **Data Volume Growth**: Mitigated by partitioning and automated cleanup
- **Query Performance**: Mitigated by materialized views and proper indexing
- **Real-time Updates**: Mitigated by 1-minute granularity requirement (not
  real-time)

### Operational Risks

- **Alert Fatigue**: Mitigated by medium sensitivity thresholds and configurable
  settings
- **Storage Costs**: Mitigated by 1-year retention limit and data aggregation
- **Monitoring System Failure**: Mitigated by graceful degradation approach

## Constitutional Compliance

All research findings align with constitutional requirements:

- ✅ Production from Day One: Real Supabase database, actual admin accounts
- ✅ Security First: RLS policies, admin-only access, audit logging
- ✅ TypeScript Strict: All new code will use strict TypeScript
- ✅ Real Data Only: Actual system metrics, real business performance data
- ✅ Monorepo Architecture: Extends existing apps/admin and packages structure
