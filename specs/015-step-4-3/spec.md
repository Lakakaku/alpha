## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-23

- Q: For alert thresholds that trigger notifications to administrators, what
  sensitivity level should the system use by default? → A: Balanced: Medium
  thresholds (2% error rate, 5s response time, 80% CPU) - standard industry
  practice
- Q: For monitoring data retention, how long should the system store performance
  metrics and logs? → A: Long-term: 1 year - annual trends, comprehensive
  historical analysis
- Q: For analytics data export functionality, which formats should the system
  support? → A: All formats - CSV, PDF, JSON for maximum flexibility
- Q: For business intelligence data updates, how frequently should the analytics
  dashboards refresh with new data? → A: When admins upload data
- Q: For monitoring system failure scenarios, what fallback approach should the
  system use when the monitoring infrastructure itself becomes unavailable? → A:
  Graceful degradation - continue core operations, log locally, sync when
  restored

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a system administrator, I need comprehensive monitoring dashboards to track
system health, detect issues early, and analyze business performance across all
Vocilia stores to ensure optimal service delivery and identify growth
opportunities.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### System Health Monitoring

1. **Given** the admin is logged into the monitoring dashboard, **When** they
   view the performance metrics, **Then** they see real-time data on API
   response times, database performance, and system uptime
2. **Given** a system error occurs, **When** it reaches the configured
   threshold, **Then** an alert is automatically sent to administrators via
   email and dashboard notification
3. **Given** the admin wants to track system usage, **When** they access the
   analytics section, **Then** they see daily/weekly/monthly trends of user
   activity, API calls, and resource utilization

#### Business Intelligence Dashboard

1. **Given** the admin wants to analyze fraud patterns, **When** they access the
   fraud detection reports, **Then** they see trends in verification failures,
   suspicious feedback patterns, and blocked transactions
2. **Given** the admin needs revenue insights, **When** they view the business
   metrics dashboard, **Then** they see total rewards paid, admin fees
   collected, and revenue per store over configurable time periods
3. **Given** the admin wants to assess store performance, **When** they filter
   by specific stores or regions, **Then** they see comparative analytics
   showing feedback volume, verification rates, and reward distributions

### Edge Cases

- **Monitoring system failure**: System continues core operations, logs
  performance data locally, and synchronizes with monitoring infrastructure when
  connectivity is restored
- **High-traffic data collection**: System maintains performance by buffering
  metrics data and processing in background queues without blocking user
  operations
- **Fraud detection recalibration**: System maintains current detection rules
  while administrators review and approve algorithm updates through the admin
  interface

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### System Health Monitoring (Task 4.3.1)

- **FR-001**: System MUST track and display real-time performance metrics
  including API response times, database query performance, and system uptime
  with 1-minute granularity
- **FR-002**: System MUST log all application errors with severity levels
  (critical, warning, info) and provide searchable error tracking interface
- **FR-003**: System MUST collect and display usage analytics including daily
  active users, API call volumes, and feature usage patterns
- **FR-004**: System MUST send automated alerts when performance metrics exceed
  configurable thresholds, with default medium sensitivity values: 2% error
  rate, 5 second response time, or 80% CPU utilization
- **FR-005**: Admin users MUST be able to configure alert thresholds and
  notification preferences (email, dashboard, SMS) to override system defaults
- **FR-006**: System MUST retain performance data for 1 year to enable annual
  trend analysis and comprehensive historical comparisons
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide health check endpoints for external monitoring
  services

#### Business Intelligence Dashboard (Task 4.3.2)

- **FR-008**: System MUST generate fraud detection reports showing verification
  failure rates, suspicious feedback patterns, and blocked transactions by store
  and time period
- **FR-009**: System MUST track and display revenue metrics including total
  rewards paid, admin fees collected, and net revenue per store
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide business performance analytics showing
  feedback volume trends, customer engagement rates, and reward distribution
  patterns
- **FR-011**: System MUST enable filtering and comparison of metrics by store,
  region, time period, and business type
- **FR-012**: System MUST export analytics data in multiple formats: CSV for
  spreadsheet analysis, PDF for formatted reports, and JSON for API integration
- **FR-013**: System MUST update business intelligence data automatically when
  administrators upload new data via CSV upload endpoint
  (/api/admin/stores/upload), fraud analysis results upload, or verification
  status updates, triggering recalculation of fraud detection reports and
  revenue analytics
- **FR-014**: System MUST calculate and display fraud detection accuracy metrics
  and false positive rates

#### Access Control & Security

- **FR-015**: Only admin users with monitoring privileges MUST be able to access
  system monitoring dashboards
- **FR-016**: Business intelligence data MUST respect existing RLS policies and
  data isolation between businesses
- **FR-017**: System MUST audit all access to monitoring and analytics features
  with timestamp and user identification

### Key Entities

- **System Metrics**: Performance measurements including response times, error
  rates, uptime statistics, and resource utilization
- **Error Logs**: Application errors with severity classification, stack traces,
  user context, and resolution status
- **Usage Analytics**: User activity patterns, feature utilization statistics,
  and system load measurements
- **Alert Rules**: Configurable thresholds and notification settings for
  automated system alerts
- **Fraud Reports**: Analysis of verification patterns, suspicious activities,
  and detection algorithm performance
- **Revenue Analytics**: Financial metrics including rewards paid, admin fees,
  and business performance indicators
- **Performance Baselines**: Historical data used for trend analysis and anomaly
  detection
