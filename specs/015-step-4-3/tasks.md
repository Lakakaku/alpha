# Tasks: System Monitoring & Analytics

**Feature**: System Monitoring & Analytics | **Branch**: 015-step-4-3 |
**Date**: 2025-09-23 **Input**: Design documents from `/specs/015-step-4-3/`

## Execution Flow

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✓
   → Tech stack: TypeScript, Next.js 14, Supabase, Tailwind CSS
   → Structure: Monorepo extending apps/admin, apps/backend
2. Load design documents ✓
   → data-model.md: 8 entities for monitoring, alerts, BI
   → contracts/monitoring-api.yaml: 12 endpoints across 4 categories
   → quickstart.md: 6 test scenarios with performance targets
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: dependencies, database migrations
   → Tests: 12 contract tests, 6 integration tests (TDD)
   → Core: 8 models, 4 services, 12 endpoints
   → Integration: middleware, real-time updates, alerts
   → Polish: performance validation, audit compliance
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = [P] for parallel execution
   → TDD: All tests before implementation
   → Dependencies: Models → Services → Endpoints
```

## Phase 3.1: Setup

### [X] T001 Install monitoring dependencies

Install required npm packages for charts, PDF generation, CSV handling

```bash
# In apps/admin and apps/backend
pnpm add recharts jspdf papaparse date-fns
pnpm add -D @types/papaparse
```

### [X] T002 [P] Create database migration for monitoring schema

Create and apply Supabase migration for all monitoring tables

- **File**: `supabase/migrations/20250923_monitoring_schema.sql`
- **Content**: All tables from data-model.md with proper indexing and
  partitioning

### [X] T003 [P] Create RLS policies migration for monitoring access

Create RLS policies for admin-only monitoring access

- **File**: `supabase/migrations/20250923_monitoring_rls.sql`

implementation**

- **Data Export**: <30 seconds for 10,000 records
- **Health Check**: <100ms response time

## Constitutional Compliance Checklist

- ✅ **Production from Day One**: Real Supabase database with actual admin
  accounts
- ✅ **Security First**: RLS policies enforced, admin-only access, audit logging
- ✅ **TypeScript Strict**: All monitoring code uses strict TypeScript mode
- ✅ **Real Data Only**: Actual system metrics, real business performance data
- ✅ **Monorepo Architecture**: Extends existing apps/admin and packages
  structure

## Validation Checklist

- [x] All 12 contracts have corresponding tests (T004-T015) ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] All 8 entities have model tasks (T022-T029)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T004-T021 before T022-T072) ✅
      COMPLETE
- [x] Parallel tasks are truly independent (different files, no shared state)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] TDD enforced: All tests must fail before implementation begins
