## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-23
- Q: What is the minimum conversation duration threshold for considering a call "successful" enough to analyze for rewards? → A: Must reach full 1-2 minute target duration
- Q: How should the system handle concurrent calls when multiple customers from the same store verify simultaneously? → A: Allow unlimited concurrent calls per store
- Q: What is the maximum number of retry attempts for failed call connections before marking a customer as "unreachable"? → A: 2 retry attempts (3 total attempts)
- Q: How long should completed call transcripts and quality assessments be retained in the system before deletion? → A: 90 days after call completion
- Q: What quality score threshold should trigger automatic flagging for manual review before reward processing? → A: No manual review - full automation

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

After a customer completes store verification, the system automatically
initiates an AI-powered phone call in Swedish. The AI conducts a natural 1-2
minute conversation asking context-specific questions about their store
experience. The customer's feedback is then analyzed for quality and legitimacy,
with rewards calculated based on the value of their input. Businesses receive
comprehensive weekly analysis of all feedback to identify trends, issues, and
improvement opportunities.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a customer has completed store verification with valid transaction
   details, **When** the verification is confirmed, **Then** an AI call is
   initiated within : timing not specified - immediately, within 5 minutes,
   scheduled? Immediately.
2. **Given** an AI call is in progress, **When** the customer provides feedback
   in Swedish, **Then** the conversation flows naturally with context-aware
   follow-up questions based on the business's configured question set
3. **Given** a feedback call has been completed, **When** the AI analyzes the
   conversation, **Then** a quality score between 2-15% is assigned based on
   legitimacy, depth, and usefulness
4. **Given** verified feedback exists for a business, **When** the weekly
   analysis period begins, **Then** comprehensive insights are generated
   including trends, positive/negative summaries, and comparative analysis
5. **Given** fraudulent or nonsensical feedback is detected, **When** the
   analysis runs, **Then** the feedback is flagged and excluded from reward
   calculations

### Edge Cases

- What happens when : customer doesn't answer the phone, hangs up mid-call, or
  speaks languages other than Swedish? Then the speaking-AI should cease the
  call, end it.
- How does system handle : technical failures during calls, poor audio quality,
  or conversation timeouts? : End the call.
- What occurs when business context window is incomplete or questions are poorly
  configured? The AI bot inside the business' contex window should let the
  business-account know that the context is weak. And if the account ignores
  that, then it is their fault.
- How are calls managed during business closed hours or holidays? They should be
  classified as fake, since our AI-speaker should from the business' context
  window know the open hours, then those calls fails on legitimacy because of
  that.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

#### Feedback Collection AI

- **FR-001**: System MUST initiate automated phone calls to verified customers using AI voice technology with unlimited concurrent calls per store and maximum 3 total attempts (2 retries) for failed connections
- **FR-002**: AI MUST conduct conversations exclusively in Swedish language
- **FR-003**: AI MUST limit conversation duration to 1-2 minutes per call and MUST complete the full target duration for successful analysis
