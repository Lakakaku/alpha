## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for
   any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login
   system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable
   and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

Security and compliance officers need comprehensive testing capabilities to
validate that the Vocilia customer feedback system protects sensitive customer
data (phone numbers, transaction details, feedback content) and meets Swedish
data protection requirements. This includes testing authentication barriers,
authorization controls, data anonymization processes, and GDPR compliance
mechanisms to ensure customer privacy is maintained throughout the QR code
verification, AI feedback call, and business verification workflows.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a security tester attempts unauthorized access to customer phone
   numbers, **When** they try various attack vectors (SQL injection, API
   manipulation, session hijacking), **Then** the system MUST block all attempts
   and log security events
2. **Given** a business account user tries to access feedback data from other
   businesses, **When** they manipulate session tokens or API calls, **Then**
   the system MUST deny access and maintain data isolation
3. **Given** customer feedback contains personally identifiable information,
   **When** the data is processed for business delivery, **Then** the system
   MUST anonymize all personal details while preserving feedback value
4. **Given** a customer requests data deletion under GDPR, **When** the deletion
   process is triggered, **Then** all personal data MUST be permanently removed
   within 72 hours maximum
5. **Given** the system stores customer transaction data temporarily, **When**
   the verification cycle completes, **Then** sensitive data MUST be
   automatically purged according to retention policies

### Edge Case Requirements

**Data Conflict Resolution**

- **FR-024**: System MUST prioritize GDPR deletion requests over ongoing business verification cycles by suspending verification, completing deletion within 72 hours, and resuming verification with remaining data
- **FR-025**: System MUST detect and block data exfiltration attempts during peak periods by implementing rate limiting, monitoring abnormal access patterns, and triggering security alerts

**System Integrity Protection**

- **FR-026**: System MUST detect compromised business verification processes by validating data integrity, monitoring for unusual patterns, and automatically quarantining suspicious verification attempts
- **FR-027**: System MUST prevent phone number enumeration attacks by implementing request throttling, masking phone number validation responses, and logging enumeration attempts

**AI Data Processing Security**

- **FR-028**: System MUST prevent AI feedback analysis from capturing personally identifiable information by implementing input sanitization, output filtering, and automated PII detection with data scrubbing

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

**Authentication Security Testing**

- **FR-001**: System MUST validate that all admin account authentication
  attempts are properly logged and monitored for brute force attacks
- **FR-002**: System MUST verify that business account sessions expire correctly
  and cannot be extended beyond authorized timeframes
- **FR-003**: System MUST confirm that password reset flows cannot be exploited
  for account takeover
- **FR-004**: System MUST verify that current authentication mechanisms cannot be bypassed (Note: Multi-factor authentication is not currently implemented in the system)

**Authorization & Access Control Testing**

- **FR-005**: System MUST verify that business accounts can only access their
  own store data and feedback
- **FR-006**: System MUST confirm that admin accounts cannot access customer
  phone numbers during normal operations
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate that QR code verification forms cannot be
  manipulated to access other store transactions

  permissions

  in business verification databases
- **FR-010**: System MUST confirm that feedback anonymization removes all
  personally identifiable information before business delivery
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate that transaction data matching tolerances (�2
  minutes, �2 SEK) cannot be exploited for data inference

  anonymity across multiple stores

**GDPR Compliance Verification**

- **FR-013**: System MUST verify that customer data deletion requests are
  processed completely within 72 hours maximum

  purge customer information after verification cycles
- **FR-015**: System MUST validate that customers can access and export their
  personal data upon request

  can be withdrawn

**Vulnerability Assessment**

  vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- **FR-018**: System MUST verify that database connections cannot be exploited
  through injection attacks
- **FR-019**: System MUST confirm that file upload processes (CSV business
  verification) are secured against malicious content
- **FR-020**: System MUST validate that AI feedback processing cannot be
  manipulated to expose system prompts, training data, or model internals

**Fraud Detection Security**

- **FR-021**: System MUST verify that fraud detection algorithms cannot be
  reverse-engineered through repeated testing
- **FR-022**: System MUST confirm that context window configurations cannot be
  manipulated to bypass verification
- **FR-023**: System MUST test that transaction validation tolerances are not
  exploitable for reward farming

- **NFR-002**: Vulnerability scans MUST complete within 30 minutes for comprehensive assessment
- **NFR-003**: GDPR deletion requests MUST be processed within 72 hours maximum

**Operational Requirements**

- **NFR-004**: Vulnerability assessments MUST be executed automatically on a weekly schedule
- **NFR-005**: Security test results MUST generate compliance reports suitable for audit review
- **NFR-006**: Failed security tests MUST trigger immediate alerting to security team

  and personal data identification across system components

  verification, feedback collection, business verification, and payment
  processing workflows
