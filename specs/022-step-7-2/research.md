# Research: Security & Privacy Testing Framework

**Date**: 2025-09-27
**Feature**: Security & Privacy Testing for Vocilia customer feedback system

## Research Decisions

### Security Testing Stack Selection

**Decision**: Jest + Playwright + Supertest + OWASP ZAP integration
**Rationale**:
- Jest already established in project for unit/integration testing
- Playwright provides robust e2e security testing with network interception
- Supertest enables API security testing with Express integration
- OWASP ZAP offers industry-standard vulnerability scanning

**Alternatives considered**:
- Cypress: Less mature security testing capabilities compared to Playwright
- Newman + Postman: Good for API testing but lacks e2e security scenarios
- Custom curl scripts: Not maintainable for complex security test scenarios

### GDPR Compliance Testing Approach

**Decision**: Automated deletion workflow testing with 72-hour validation
**Rationale**:
- Legal requirement for 72-hour response confirmed in clarifications
- Automated testing ensures consistent compliance validation
- Integration with existing Supabase data lifecycle management

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual compliance verification: Not scalable and error-prone
- External GDPR service: Adds dependency and doesn't validate internal processes
- Longer timeframes: Non-compliant with Swedish data protection requirements

### AI Model Security Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Full AI model security including training data exposure testing
**Rationale**:
- GPT-4o-mini integration requires protection against prompt injection
- Customer feedback contains sensitive data requiring model security
- Training data exposure could reveal system prompts and business logic

**Alternatives considered**:
- Input validation only: Insufficient for AI-specific attack vectors
- External AI security service: Doesn't understand domain-specific context
- Limited scope testing: Leaves critical AI vulnerabilities untested

### Performance Impact Management

**Decision**: ≤10% performance degradation with isolated test environments
**Rationale**:
- Clarification specified 10% maximum impact acceptable
- Security testing must not disrupt production customer experience
- Railway/Vercel infrastructure supports environment isolation

**Alternatives considered**:
- Zero impact requirement: Unrealistic for comprehensive security testing
- Higher impact tolerance: Could affect customer satisfaction and business metrics
- Maintenance window only: Insufficient for continuous security monitoring

### Vulnerability Scanning Automation

**Decision**: Weekly automated OWASP Top 10 + custom security rules with compliance reporting
**Rationale**:
- Weekly schedule balances thoroughness with resource efficiency
- OWASP Top 10 provides industry-standard vulnerability coverage
- Custom rules address Vocilia-specific attack vectors (QR manipulation, payment fraud)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Daily scanning: Resource intensive without proportional security benefit
- Monthly scanning: Too infrequent for production system with payment processing
- Manual scanning only: Not scalable and inconsistent coverage

### Access Control for Security Testing

**Decision**: Full admin access for security testers with audit logging
**Rationale**:
- Clarification confirmed full admin access requirement
- Security testing requires ability to test privilege escalation scenarios
- Audit logging maintains accountability and compliance tracking

**Alternatives considered**:
- Limited test permissions: Cannot validate authorization boundary testing
- Production access: Security risk for live customer data
- Read-only access: Insufficient for testing data modification attacks

## Technology Integration Patterns

### Supabase RLS Security Testing

**Pattern**: Automated RLS policy validation with role switching
**Implementation approach**:
- Create test accounts with different roles (admin, business, customer)
- Validate data isolation between business accounts
- Test RLS policy bypass attempts with malformed queries

### Express.js API Security Testing

**Pattern**: Middleware security testing with Supertest
**Implementation approach**:
- Test authentication middleware with invalid tokens
- Validate rate limiting under attack scenarios
- Test input sanitization with SQL injection payloads

### Next.js Frontend Security Testing

**Pattern**: E2E security testing with Playwright browser automation
**Implementation approach**:
- Test session management and CSRF protection
- Validate client-side data masking (phone numbers, payment data)
- Test XSS prevention in feedback display components

### Payment System Security Testing

**Pattern**: Mock Swish integration with security validation
**Implementation approach**:
- Test payment data encryption and anonymization
- Validate reward calculation tampering resistance
- Test transaction verification security boundaries

## Security Test Categories

### Authentication Security
- Brute force attack resistance
- Session management security
- Password reset flow security
- Multi-factor authentication bypass attempts

### Authorization & Access Control
- Business account data isolation
- Admin privilege boundary testing
- QR code manipulation resistance
- API endpoint permission enforcement

### Data Privacy Protection
- Customer phone number protection
- Feedback anonymization validation
- Transaction data inference prevention
- Cross-store anonymity maintenance

### GDPR Compliance
- 72-hour deletion request processing
- Data retention policy automation
- Personal data access/export validation
- Consent mechanism testing

### Vulnerability Assessment
- OWASP Top 10 automated testing
- SQL injection prevention
- File upload security (CSV processing)
- AI feedback processing security

### Fraud Detection Security
- Algorithm reverse-engineering resistance
- Context window manipulation testing
- Transaction validation bypass attempts

## Performance and Monitoring

### Test Performance Metrics
- Security test execution time: <5 minutes per test suite
- Performance impact during testing: ≤10% degradation
- Weekly scan duration: <30 minutes for full suite
- GDPR deletion validation: <1 minute response time

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Failed security tests trigger immediate alerts
- Performance degradation monitoring during test execution
- Weekly compliance report generation
- Vulnerability discovery notification workflow

## Compliance and Reporting

### Swedish Data Protection Requirements
- 72-hour GDPR deletion response validation
- Personal data handling audit trails
- Cross-border data transfer security (Supabase EU)
- Customer consent management testing

### Security Audit Trail
- All security test executions logged with timestamps
- Test result artifacts stored for compliance review
- Performance impact metrics recorded
- Vulnerability discovery and remediation tracking
