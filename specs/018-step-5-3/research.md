# Research: Fraud Detection & Security

**Phase 0 Output** | **Date**: 2025-09-24 | **Feature**: 018-step-5-3

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. Context-Based Legitimacy Analysis Patterns

**Decision**: Implement semantic similarity scoring using vector embeddings + rule-based validation

**Rationale**: 
- GPT-4o-mini already integrated for voice processing - leverage for context analysis
- Vector embeddings provide semantic understanding of feedback vs store context
- Rule-based validation catches obvious mismatches (flying elephants in dairy section)
- Composite scoring combines multiple detection methods

**Alternatives considered**:
- Pure rule-based: Too rigid, misses nuanced fraud
- ML training: Requires large fraud dataset, complex infrastructure
- Third-party fraud APIs: External dependencies, cost scaling issues

### 2. Red Flag Keyword Detection Implementation

**Decision**: Multi-tier keyword classification with severity weighting

**Rationale**:
- Categorized detection: profanity, threats, nonsensical, impossible suggestions
- Severity levels allow graduated response (warning vs blocking)
- Swedish language support required for local market
- Real-time processing during voice call analysis

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single keyword list: Lacks nuance, too many false positives
- ML-based text classification: Overkill for initial implementation
- External content moderation APIs: Latency issues for real-time calls

### 3. Behavioral Pattern Analysis Architecture

**Decision**: Event-driven pattern detection with sliding window analysis

**Rationale**:
- Real-time detection during feedback submission
- Sliding window (30 minutes, 24 hours, 7 days) captures different fraud patterns
- Event sourcing enables pattern replay and analysis
- Phone number verification prevents household coordination

**Alternatives considered**:
- Batch processing: Too slow for fraud prevention
- Complex ML clustering: Over-engineered for behavioral patterns
- Session-based only: Misses cross-session fraud attempts

### 4. Supabase RLS Policy Enhancement Patterns

**Decision**: Function-based RLS with role hierarchy and data classification

**Rationale**:
- Function-based policies enable complex authorization logic
- Role hierarchy: customer < business < admin < super_admin
- Data classification: public, internal, sensitive, restricted
- Audit trail integration for all policy violations

**Alternatives considered**:
- Simple row-based RLS: Insufficient for complex fraud scenarios
- Application-level authorization: Security risks, performance issues
- External authorization service: Adds complexity, latency

### 5. Audit Logging Best Practices for Security

**Decision**: Structured logging with immutable append-only audit trail

**Rationale**:
- JSON structured logs for queryability and analysis
- Immutable storage prevents tampering with audit evidence
- Correlation IDs track related events across services
- Real-time streaming to security monitoring systems

**Alternatives considered**:
- Simple application logs: Insufficient for security auditing
- Database triggers only: Performance impact, limited context
- External SIEM integration: Complex setup, vendor lock-in

### 6. Intrusion Detection Implementation

**Decision**: Rate limiting + anomaly detection with automated response

**Rationale**:
- Multiple detection layers: rate limiting, pattern analysis, threat intelligence
- Automated response: temporary blocking, admin alerts, evidence collection
- Integration with existing middleware for minimal performance impact
- Configurable thresholds per environment (dev, staging, production)

**Alternatives considered**:
- WAF-only approach: Limited to web attacks, misses application-level threats
- Log analysis only: Reactive, not preventive
- Full SIEM deployment: Over-engineered for current scale

### 7. Data Encryption at Rest Strategy

**Decision**: Application-level encryption for sensitive fields + database TDE

**Rationale**:
- Application-level encryption for phone numbers, feedback content, customer PII
- Supabase Transparent Data Encryption for database-level protection
- Key management through environment variables with rotation capability
- Performance-optimized: encrypt only sensitive fields, not all data

**Alternatives considered**:
- Database-only encryption: Application has access to plaintext
- Full disk encryption only: Insufficient for multi-tenant security
- External key management: Adds complexity, potential failure points

## Technology Integration Decisions

### Fraud Detection Stack
- **Context Analysis**: GPT-4o-mini API for semantic analysis
- **Pattern Detection**: Custom TypeScript services with Redis caching
- **Scoring Engine**: Composite scoring algorithm (0-100 scale)
- **Real-time Processing**: Event-driven architecture with Supabase realtime

### Security Hardening Stack
- **RLS Enhancement**: Supabase advanced RLS with custom functions
- **Audit Logging**: Structured JSON logs with correlation tracking
- **Intrusion Detection**: Rate limiting middleware + anomaly detection
- **Encryption**: Node.js crypto module + Supabase TDE

### Performance Considerations
- **Fraud Detection Response**: <500ms target through caching and async processing
- **Security Monitoring**: <100ms for real-time threat detection
- **Audit Log Ingestion**: Async processing to avoid request blocking
- **Database Impact**: Optimized queries with proper indexing strategy
