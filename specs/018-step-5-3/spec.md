## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a business owner using Vocilia's customer feedback system, I need robust
fraud detection and security measures to ensure that only legitimate customer
feedback is rewarded, protecting my business from fake feedback attempts and
maintaining the integrity of the reward payments, while ensuring the system is
secure against malicious attacks and data breaches.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Advanced Fraud Detection

1. **Given** a customer provides feedback about "flying elephants in the dairy
   section", **When** the AI analyzes the feedback against the store's context
   window, **Then** the system flags it as fraudulent with a legitimacy score
   below 20% and no reward is issued
2. **Given** a customer calls multiple times from the same phone number within
   30 minutes for different "transactions", **When** the behavioral analysis
   runs, **Then** the system detects the pattern and flags subsequent calls as
   potentially fraudulent
3. **Given** a customer provides feedback containing red flag keywords like
   "bomb" or "terrorist attack", **When** the keyword detection system processes
   the call, **Then** the feedback is immediately flagged for security review
   and no reward is processed
4. **Given** multiple customers provide identical or near-identical feedback for
   the same store, **When** the pattern analysis runs, **Then** the system
   detects coordinated fraud attempts and flags all related feedback

#### Security Hardening

1. **Given** an unauthorized user attempts to access customer phone numbers,
   **When** they query the database, **Then** RLS policies prevent access and
   the attempt is logged in the audit system
2. **Given** an admin performs sensitive actions like accessing customer data,
   **When** the action is completed, **Then** comprehensive audit logs capture
   who, what, when, where, and why with tamper-proof timestamps
3. **Given** multiple failed login attempts occur from the same IP address,
   **When** the intrusion detection system analyzes the pattern, **Then** the
   system temporarily blocks the IP and alerts administrators
4. **Given** customer feedback data is stored in the database, **When** data is
   at rest, **Then** all sensitive information is encrypted using
   industry-standard encryption methods

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-24

- Q: For customers with disabilities who provide unusual but legitimate feedback
  (e.g., speech impediments, cognitive differences), how should the fraud
  detection system handle their responses? → A: Treat identical to standard
  fraud detection without special handling
- Q: When business owners attempt to manipulate their own fraud detection
  settings (e.g., lowering thresholds to accept more fraudulent feedback for
  higher rewards), what should the system do? → A: Prevent any business owner
  changes to fraud detection settings
- Q: How should the system differentiate between legitimate family members
  providing separate feedback versus coordinated fraud attempts from the same
  household? → A: Require phone number verification to prevent household
  coordination
- Q: When intrusion detection identifies suspicious activity, what response time
  is required for administrator alerts? → A: <2s
- Q: For the automated security monitoring thresholds mentioned in FR-012, what
  constitutes "suspicious activities" that trigger real-time alerts? → A:
  Multiple failed logins, unusual data access patterns, privilege escalation
  attempts

### Edge Cases

- What happens when legitimate feedback coincidentally contains red flag
  keywords? System allows feedback to pass through normal processing
- How does the system handle customers with disabilities who provide unusual but
  legitimate feedback? System applies standard fraud detection without special
  accommodations
- What occurs when a business owner attempts to manipulate their own fraud
  detection settings? System prevents all business owner modifications to fraud
  detection parameters
- How does the system differentiate between legitimate family members providing
  feedback vs. coordinated fraud? System requires unique phone number
  verification for each feedback submission

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Advanced Fraud Detection (Task 5.3.1)

- **FR-001**: System MUST analyze feedback legitimacy against each store's
  specific context window data, scoring feedback from 0-100% based on contextual
  accuracy
- **FR-002**: System MUST detect and flag red flag keywords including profanity,
  threats, nonsensical responses, and contextually impossible suggestions
- **FR-003**: System MUST track behavioral patterns including call frequency per
  phone number, time patterns, geographical inconsistencies, and feedback
  similarity across customers, requiring unique phone number verification to
  prevent household coordination fraud
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate automated fraud scores combining context
  analysis (40%), keyword detection (20%), behavioral patterns (30%), and
  transaction verification (10%)
- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent reward processing for feedback scoring below
  70% legitimacy threshold
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain a learning database of confirmed fraudulent
  patterns to improve detection accuracy over time

#### Security Hardening (Task 5.3.2)

- **FR-007**: System MUST implement comprehensive Row Level Security policies
  ensuring users can only access data they are authorized to view
- **FR-008**: System MUST log all database access attempts, administrative
  actions, authentication events, and data modifications with tamper-proof
  timestamps
- **FR-009**: System MUST detect and respond to intrusion attempts including
  brute force attacks, SQL injection attempts, and unusual access patterns
- **FR-010**: System MUST encrypt all customer data at rest using AES-256
  encryption, including phone numbers, feedback content, and transaction details
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide role-based access control with strict
  separation between customer, business, and admin access levels
- **FR-012**: System MUST implement automated security monitoring with real-time
  alerts for suspicious activities including multiple failed logins, unusual
  data access patterns, and privilege escalation attempts
- **FR-013**: System MUST prevent business owners from modifying fraud detection
  settings, maintaining admin-only control over detection parameters

### Key Entities

#### Fraud Detection Entities

- **Fraud Score**: Composite score (0-100%) combining context analysis, keyword
  flags, behavioral patterns, and transaction verification with detailed
  breakdown for each component
- **Context Analysis**: Store-specific legitimacy assessment comparing feedback
  content against business context window data, recent changes, and physical
  layout
- **Behavioral Pattern**: Customer usage patterns including call frequency,
  timing patterns, geographical consistency, and similarity to other customers
- **Red Flag Keywords**: Categorized keyword database including profanity,
  threats, nonsensical terms, and contextually impossible suggestions with
  severity levels

#### Security Entities

- **Audit Log**: Comprehensive security event record including user identity,
  action performed, timestamp, IP address, affected data, and result status
- **RLS Policy**: Database-level security rule defining data access permissions
  based on user role, ownership, and contextual authorization
- **Intrusion Event**: Security incident record including attack type, source
  information, targeted resources, detection method, and response actions
- **Encryption Key**: Data protection mechanism ensuring sensitive information
  remains secure at rest with proper key rotation and management
