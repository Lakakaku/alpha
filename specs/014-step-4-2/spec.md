## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator, I need comprehensive monitoring dashboards to track system health, detect issues early, and analyze business performance across all Vocilia stores to ensure optimal service delivery and identify growth opportunities.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### System Health Monitoring
1. **Given** the admin is logged into the monitoring dashboard, **When** they view the performance metrics, **Then** they see real-time data on API response times, database performance, and system uptime
2. **Given** a system error occurs, **When** it reaches the configured threshold, **Then** an alert is automatically sent to administrators via email and dashboard notification
3. **Given** the admin wants to track system usage, **When** they access the analytics section, **Then** they see daily/weekly/monthly trends of user activity, API calls, and resource utilization

#### Business Intelligence Dashboard
1. **Given** the admin wants to analyze fraud patterns, **When** they access the fraud detection reports, **Then** they see trends in verification failures, suspicious feedback patterns, and blocked transactions
2. **Given** the admin needs revenue insights, **When** they view the business metrics dashboard, **Then** they see total rewards paid, admin fees collected, and revenue per store over configurable time periods
3. **Given** the admin wants to assess store performance, **When** they filter by specific stores or regions, **Then** they see comparative analytics showing feedback volume, verification rates, and reward distributions

### Edge Cases
- What happens when monitoring systems themselves fail or become unresponsive?
- How does the system handle data collection during high-traffic periods without impacting performance?
- What occurs when fraud detection algorithms need recalibration based on evolving patterns?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### System Health Monitoring (Task 4.3.1)
- **FR-001**: System MUST track and display real-time performance metrics including API response times, database query performance, and system uptime with 1-minute granularity
- **FR-002**: System MUST log all application errors with severity levels (critical, warning, info) and provide searchable error tracking interface
- **FR-003**: System MUST collect and display usage analytics including daily active users, API call volumes, and feature usage patterns
- **FR-004**: System MUST send automated alerts when performance metrics exceed [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific thresholds not defined - CPU usage %, response time limits, error rates?]
- **FR-005**: Admin users MUST be able to configure alert thresholds and notification preferences (email, dashboard, SMS)
- **FR-006**: System MUST retain performance data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified - 30 days, 90 days, 1 year?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide health check endpoints for external monitoring services

#### Business Intelligence Dashboard (Task 4.3.2)
- **FR-008**: System MUST generate fraud detection reports showing verification failure rates, suspicious feedback patterns, and blocked transactions by store and time period
- **FR-009**: System MUST track and display revenue metrics including total rewards paid, admin fees collected, and net revenue per store
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide business performance analytics showing feedback volume trends, customer engagement rates, and reward distribution patterns
- **FR-011**: System MUST enable filtering and comparison of metrics by store, region, time period, and business type
- **FR-012**: System MUST export analytics data in [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: export formats not specified - CSV, PDF, JSON?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST update business intelligence data with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: refresh frequency not specified - real-time, hourly, daily?]
- **FR-014**: System MUST calculate and display fraud detection accuracy metrics and false positive rates

#### Access Control & Security
- **FR-015**: Only admin users with monitoring privileges MUST be able to access system monitoring dashboards
- **FR-016**: Business intelligence data MUST respect existing RLS policies and data isolation between businesses
- **FR-017**: System MUST audit all access to monitoring and analytics features with timestamp and user identification

### Key Entities

- **System Metrics**: Performance measurements including response times, error rates, uptime statistics, and resource utilization
- **Error Logs**: Application errors with severity classification, stack traces, user context, and resolution status
- **Usage Analytics**: User activity patterns, feature utilization statistics, and system load measurements
- **Alert Rules**: Configurable thresholds and notification settings for automated system alerts
- **Fraud Reports**: Analysis of verification patterns, suspicious activities, and detection algorithm performance
- **Revenue Analytics**: Financial metrics including rewards paid, admin fees, and business performance indicators
- **Performance Baselines**: Historical data used for trend analysis and anomaly detection
