## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A customer visits a Swedish business, scans a QR code with their mobile phone,
provides verification details on a mobile-optimized interface, receives an AI
phone call for feedback, and then sees confirmation of call completion with
expected reward timeline - all while having accessibility support and offline
capability for basic functions.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** customer scans QR code on mobile device, **When** they access
   verification page, **Then** interface is optimized for mobile input with
   large touch targets and easy keyboard access
2. **Given** customer has poor network connection, **When** they enter
   verification details, **Then** basic functions work offline and sync when
   connection returns
3. **Given** customer completes AI feedback call, **When** call ends, **Then**
   they see confirmation screen with expected reward timeline and submission
   status
4. **Given** customer uses screen reader or other accessibility tools, **When**
   they navigate the interface, **Then** all elements are properly labeled and
   navigable
5. **Given** customer needs help, **When** they look for support, **Then**
   customer support contact information is clearly accessible
6. **Given** customer wants to save for later use, **When** prompted, **Then**
   they can install the progressive web app for quick access

### Edge Cases

- What happens when customer is offline during verification submission? I do not
  understand what you mean. The customer may be online when having its feedback
  call. The verification process is the stores/businessess doing themselves by
  checking their POS systems to our database we are uploading to them.
- How does system handle PWA installation on different mobile browsers? Find the
  smartest solution.
- What accessibility features are needed for customers with visual or motor
  impairments? Find the smartest solution.
- How does system behave when customer closes app during call? Delete that
  feedback call, do not track it.
