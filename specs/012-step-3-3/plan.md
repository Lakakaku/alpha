## Summary
Mobile-first customer interface enhancements for QR code scanning and verification, including Progressive Web App features, offline capability, accessibility compliance, call completion confirmation, reward timeline display, feedback submission status tracking, and customer support integration. The implementation will enhance the existing customer app within the Vocilia Alpha monorepo architecture using Next.js, Supabase, and existing infrastructure.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript with Node.js 18+ (existing project stack)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 14, Supabase client, Tailwind CSS, GPT-4o-mini API (existing)  
**Storage**: Supabase PostgreSQL with RLS policies (existing)  
**Testing**: Jest with TypeScript support (existing)  
**Target Platform**: Mobile web browsers, PWA-compatible browsers  
**Project Type**: web (frontend+backend - existing monorepo)  
**Performance Goals**: <3s initial load, <1s subsequent page loads, 90+ Lighthouse scores  
**Constraints**: Mobile-first responsive design, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, offline-first capability  
**Scale/Scope**: Customer interface for Swedish market, PWA installation for 10k+ users

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] **Production from Day One**: Using existing Supabase, real QR codes, actual PWA installation
- [x] **TypeScript Strict Mode**: All new components will use strict TypeScript compilation
- [x] **Real Data Only**: Existing call sessions, real customer verification data, actual accessibility testing
- [x] **Monorepo Architecture**: Enhancing existing customer app, shared packages maintained
- [x] **Stack Requirements**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (existing), Supabase (existing)

**Status**: PASS - All constitutional requirements met with existing infrastructure

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - enhancing existing monorepo structure

## Phase 0: Outline & Research ✓

Research completed for:
- **PWA Installation Patterns**: Industry best practices for mobile PWA prompts and installation flows
- **Offline-First Architecture**: Service worker strategies, background sync, IndexedDB caching
- **Mobile Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for touch interfaces, screen readers, motor impairments
- **Call Status Integration**: Real-time updates with existing call session management
- **Customer Support Integration**: Multi-channel support patterns within existing customer interface

**Output**: [research.md](./research.md) - All technical unknowns resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts ✓

**Data Model Changes**:
- Enhanced call session status tracking
- Offline submission queue with sync states
- Customer support request entities
- PWA installation preference tracking
- Accessibility configuration storage

**API Contract Updates**:
- Call status polling endpoints
- Offline sync batch processing
- Customer support submission APIs
- PWA manifest and service worker resources

**Contract Tests Generated**:
- Call completion confirmation flow
- Offline submission and sync validation
- Accessibility compliance verification
- PWA installation and caching behavior

**Output**: [data-model.md](./data-model.md), [/contracts/*](./contracts/), failing tests, [quickstart.md](./quickstart.md), [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md)

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each API contract → contract test task [P]
- Each UI component → component creation task [P]
- Each accessibility requirement → compliance test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Types → Services → Components → Pages
- Parallel groups: Independent UI components, separate API endpoints
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 28-32 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md including:
1-8: Contract tests for API endpoints [P]
9-12: Database schema updates [Sequential]
13-20: UI component creation [P]
21-24: Accessibility compliance tests [P]
25-28: Integration tests for user flows [Sequential]
29-32: PWA and offline functionality [Sequential]

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations - no entries needed*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (N/A)
