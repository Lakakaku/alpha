# Research: Customer Interface Polish

## PWA Installation Patterns

### Decision: Context-aware installation prompts
**Rationale**: Display PWA installation prompt after successful verification completion, when user value is established and engagement is high.

**Implementation Approach**:
- Detect PWA install capability using `beforeinstallprompt` event
- Show custom install banner after call completion confirmation
- Provide manual install option in settings/help section
- Store user preference to avoid repeated prompts

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Immediate prompt on first visit (rejected: too aggressive, low conversion)
- Manual-only installation (rejected: reduces adoption)
- Timer-based prompts (rejected: not value-aligned)

## Offline-First Architecture

### Decision: Progressive enhancement with background sync
**Rationale**: Essential for mobile users with poor connectivity during verification process.

**Implementation Approach**:
- Service Worker with Cache First strategy for static assets
- IndexedDB for offline verification queue with automatic sync
- Background Sync API for reliable data submission
- Network-first for real-time call status, fallback to cached state

**Key Components**:
- Offline queue manager service
- Sync conflict resolution for verification data
- User feedback for offline/online states
- Graceful degradation for call scheduling

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Full offline capability including calls (rejected: calls require real-time connectivity)
- Cache-only approach (rejected: doesn't handle form submissions)
- Manual sync only (rejected: poor user experience)

## Mobile Accessibility

### Decision: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with mobile optimizations
**Rationale**: Legal compliance requirement in Sweden, improves usability for all users.

**Implementation Approach**:
- Minimum 44px touch targets for all interactive elements
- Screen reader support with semantic HTML and ARIA labels
- High contrast mode support (4.5:1 minimum ratio)
- Keyboard navigation for all functions
- Voice control compatibility
- Reduced motion preferences support

**Key Requirements**:
- Skip navigation links for screen readers
- Form field labels and error announcements
- Progress indicators with accessible text
- Alternative text for all images/icons
- Focus management for dynamic content

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Basic accessibility (rejected: doesn't meet legal requirements)
- AA+ compliance (rejected: unnecessary complexity for this scope)

## Call Status Integration

### Decision: Real-time polling with WebSocket fallback
**Rationale**: Leverage existing call session infrastructure while providing immediate status updates.

**Implementation Approach**:
- Extend existing call session API with status endpoints
- Short polling (2-second intervals) during active calls
- WebSocket connection for real-time updates when available
- Optimistic UI updates for better perceived performance

**Status States**:
- `verification_pending`: User submitted, awaiting call scheduling
- `call_scheduled`: Call queued with telephony provider
- `call_in_progress`: Active AI conversation
- `call_completed`: Feedback submitted, awaiting analysis
- `reward_calculated`: Final status with reward information

**Alternatives Considered**:
- WebSocket-only (rejected: adds complexity, not always available)
- Long polling (rejected: battery drain on mobile)
- Push notifications (rejected: requires additional permissions)

## Customer Support Integration

### Decision: Multi-channel embedded support with escalation paths
**Rationale**: Reduce support burden while providing immediate help for common issues.

**Implementation Approach**:
- Contextual FAQ section based on current user state
- Live chat widget integration with existing support system
- Technical issue reporting with automatic diagnostic data
- Phone/email fallback for complex issues

**Support Channels**:
- Self-service FAQ with search functionality
- In-app messaging for verification issues
- Email support for account/reward questions
- Phone support for urgent technical problems

**Context-Aware Help**:
- Verification troubleshooting during form submission
- Call quality help during/after calls
- Reward timeline explanations after call completion
- Technical issue reporting with device diagnostics

**Alternatives Considered**:
- External support portal (rejected: breaks user flow)
- Email-only support (rejected: slow response for urgent issues)
- Chatbot-only (rejected: too many edge cases for automation)

## Performance Optimization

### Decision: Mobile-first performance with progressive loading
**Rationale**: Swedish mobile networks vary significantly, especially in rural areas.

**Key Strategies**:
- Critical CSS inlining for above-the-fold content
- Image optimization with WebP/AVIF formats
- Lazy loading for non-critical components
- Bundle splitting for faster initial loads
- Service Worker caching for repeat visits

**Performance Targets**:
- First Contentful Paint: <1.5s on 3G
- Largest Contentful Paint: <2.5s on 3G
- Time to Interactive: <3s on 3G
- Lighthouse Performance Score: >90

## Security Considerations

### Decision: Enhanced security for mobile environment
**Rationale**: Mobile devices have unique security challenges requiring additional protections.

**Security Measures**:
- Content Security Policy for PWA
- Secure context requirements (HTTPS only)
- Input sanitization for all form fields
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Secure storage for offline data
- Biometric authentication for PWA (future enhancement)

**Privacy Protections**:
- No sensitive data in localStorage
- Encrypted offline storage for PII
- Automatic session cleanup
- Clear data retention policies
