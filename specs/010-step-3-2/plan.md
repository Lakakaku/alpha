# Implementation Plan: AI Call Integration Infrastructure

**Branch**: `010-step-3-2` | **Date**: 2025-09-22 | **Spec**: [/Users/lucasjenner/alpha/specs/010-step-3-2/spec.md]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/010-step-3-2/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Implement AI-powered phone call system for customer feedback collection using Swedish-speaking GPT-4o-mini. System initiates calls within 5 minutes of customer verification, conducts 1-2 minute structured interviews based on business context and question configurations, with intelligent question selection and call flow management.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript with Node.js 18+ (existing project stack)
**Primary Dependencies**: GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI), Telephony provider (Twilio or similar), Supabase PostgreSQL, Railway deployment
**Storage**: Supabase PostgreSQL with RLS policies for call sessions, logs, question configurations
**Testing**: Jest with TypeScript support (existing project setup)
**Target Platform**: Railway backend services with Vercel frontend deployment
**Project Type**: web - backend services for call management, frontend dashboard for business users
**Performance Goals**: <5 minute call initiation, 1-2 minute call duration, 99% call completion rate
**Constraints**: Swedish language only, production-ready integrations only, strict TypeScript compilation
**Scale/Scope**: Support for multiple stores, thousands of daily calls, real-time call management

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**✅ Production from Day One**: Real telephony provider integration (Twilio), actual GPT-4o-mini API calls, production Supabase database
**✅ Security & Privacy First**: Customer phone numbers protected, call logs with RLS policies, secure API key management
**✅ TypeScript Strict Mode**: All call management code in strict TypeScript, type-safe telephony integration
**✅ Real Data Only**: Actual call sessions in Supabase, real customer phone numbers, production call logs
**✅ Monorepo Architecture**: Backend call services on Railway, business dashboard updates on Vercel
**✅ Stack Requirements**: Node.js backend services, TypeScript throughout, Supabase database, GPT-4o-mini integration
**✅ Deployment Architecture**: Backend call infrastructure on Railway, dashboard components on Vercel

**No constitutional violations identified**

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 - Web application (existing monorepo with backend services and frontend dashboards)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Telephony provider selection criteria and implementation
   - Swedish language GPT-4o-mini voice integration patterns
   - Call duration monitoring and timeout mechanisms
   - Question selection algorithm design
   - Call retry and failure handling strategies

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research best telephony providers for Swedish market with Node.js integration"
   Task: "Find best practices for GPT-4o-mini voice call integration with time constraints"
   Task: "Research call state management and monitoring patterns"
   Task: "Find algorithms for intelligent question selection based on frequency and context"
   Task: "Research telephony service reliability and retry strategies"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Call Session: phone_number, start_time, end_time, status, questions_asked, responses
   - Question Configuration: business_id, question_text, frequency, department_tags, priority
   - Business Context: store_info, question_settings, call_preferences
   - Call Log: session_id, events, duration, completion_status
   - Telephony Provider: call_id, provider_status, quality_metrics

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - POST /api/calls/initiate - Start call for verified customer
   - GET /api/calls/{sessionId}/status - Monitor call progress
   - POST /api/calls/{sessionId}/complete - Mark call completion
   - GET /api/questions/select - Get questions for business context
   - POST /api/calls/logs - Log call events
   - Use OpenAPI 3.0 specification format
   - Output to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Customer verification → call initiation flow
   - Question selection based on business context
   - Call duration monitoring and timeout
   - Multiple question combination logic
   - Call failure and retry scenarios

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run update script for Claude Code context
   - Add AI call integration technical context
   - Preserve existing manual additions
   - Update with new telephony and voice AI patterns
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Telephony integration before AI integration
- Call management before question selection
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

No constitutional violations identified - all requirements align with existing architecture and principles.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
