# Feature Specification: AI Call Integration Infrastructure

**Feature Branch**: `010-step-3-2` **Created**: 2025-09-22 **Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "### Step 3.2: AI Call Integration Infrastructure

- [ ] **Task 3.2.1**: Phone call system foundation
  - Research and select telephony provider
  - Set up Swedish language GPT-4o-mini integration
  - Create call initiation workflow
  - Build call duration monitoring (1-2 minutes)
- [ ] **Task 3.2.2**: Question delivery system
  - Implement business context integration
  - Create dynamic question selection logic
  - Build frequency-based question combination
  - Set up call flow management -------------- here is some overall context
    about the whole project: '/Users/lucasjenner/alpha/VISION.md'"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identified: AI-powered calls, telephony integration, Swedish language support, question delivery
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific telephony provider selection criteria]
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: call quality and reliability requirements]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � User flow: Customer verification � call initiation � AI conversation � call completion
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Focus on call functionality and question delivery
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   � Call sessions, questions, business context, call logs
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

After a customer provides their verification details (transaction time, value,
and phone number), the system automatically initiates an AI-powered phone call
within minutes. The customer receives a call from a Swedish-speaking AI
assistant that conducts a structured interview about their store experience,
asking relevant questions based on the business's configured context and
question preferences. The call is completed within 1-2 minutes, providing the
customer with a smooth feedback experience while collecting valuable insights
for the business.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a customer has completed verification with valid transaction
   details, **When** the call initiation process begins, **Then** the customer
   receives a phone call within 5 minutes from a Swedish-speaking AI assistant
2. **Given** a business has configured specific questions with frequency
   settings, **When** an AI call is initiated, **Then** the appropriate
   questions are selected and asked based on the customer count and business
   context
3. **Given** an AI call is in progress, **When** the conversation reaches the
   2-minute mark, **Then** the call is gracefully concluded with a thank you
   message
4. **Given** a customer answers the AI call, **When** the conversation begins,
   **Then** the AI introduces itself, explains the purpose, and asks for consent
   to proceed
5. **Given** multiple questions are selected for a call, **When** the AI
   conducts the interview, **Then** questions are combined logically and
   delivered within the time constraint

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a customer doesn't answer the initial call attempt?
- How does the system handle customers who hang up mid-conversation?
- What occurs if the telephony service is temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system manage call costs when customers engage in very long
  responses?
- What happens if no questions are configured for a business when a call is
  initiated?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST initiate phone calls to verified customers within 5
  minutes of verification completion
- **FR-002**: System MUST conduct calls using Swedish-speaking AI assistant
  (GPT-4o-mini integration)
- **FR-003**: System MUST limit call duration to 1-2 minutes maximum per session
- **FR-004**: System MUST select and deliver questions based on business context
  configuration and frequency settings
- **FR-005**: System MUST combine multiple questions intelligently when multiple
  are due for the same customer
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle call failures gracefully with : retry policy
  and maximum attempts not specified; set a reasonable limit
- **FR-007**: System MUST obtain customer consent before proceeding with the
  feedback interview
- **FR-008**: System MUST log all call attempts, durations, and completion
  status for business analytics
- **FR-009**: System MUST integrate with business context configuration to
  determine relevant questions
- **FR-010**: System MUST manage call flow to ensure natural conversation
  progression
- **FR-011**: System MUST support : telephony provider not specified - requires
  provider selection criteria - I do now know what you mean. Find the best and
  most reasonable solution.
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle customers who speak languages other than
  Swedish with : fallback behavior not defined; Go only for Swedish
- **FR-013**: System MUST ensure call quality meets : audio quality standards
  not specified; Find a reasonable standard.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Call Session**: Represents an individual AI-powered call, includes customer
  phone number, start/end times, completion status, questions asked, and
  responses received
- **Question Configuration**: Business-defined questions with frequency
  settings, department tags, priority levels, and active periods
- **Business Context**: Store-specific information that guides question
  selection and call personalization
- **Call Log**: Historical record of all call attempts and outcomes for
  analytics and troubleshooting
- **Telephony Provider**: External service integration for making actual phone
  calls with quality and reliability metrics
