## Summary
Deploy the complete Vocilia customer feedback reward system to production environments with Railway (backend), Vercel (frontends), and Supabase (database). Includes staging environments, custom domains, SSL certificates, monitoring, and backup strategies for medium-volume traffic (1,000-10,000 customers/month) with 99.5% uptime target.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript with Node.js 18+ (existing)
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 14, Supabase client, Railway CLI, Vercel CLI (existing)
**Storage**: Supabase PostgreSQL with RLS policies (existing)
**Testing**: Jest with TypeScript support (existing)
**Target Platform**: Railway (backend), Vercel (frontends), Supabase (database)
**Project Type**: web - monorepo with three apps (customer, business, admin) + shared packages
**Performance Goals**: <2s page loads, 99.5% uptime, 100-500 concurrent users
**Constraints**: Medium volume (1K-10K customers/month), 15-minute rollback capability, daily backups
**Deployment Resilience**: Manual verification checklist for env vars, connection pooling with automatic retry, rollback to previous deployment artifacts
**Scale/Scope**: Three applications, separate domains, staging + production environments

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Production from Day One ✅
- All deployment configurations will be production-ready from initial setup
- Real environment variables, actual SSL certificates, live monitoring
- No mock deployment scripts or placeholder configurations

### Security & Privacy First ✅
- SSL certificates mandatory for all domains
- Environment variable encryption and secure storage
- Database connection pooling with RLS policies maintained
- Backup encryption and access controls

### TypeScript Strict Mode ✅
- All deployment configuration files in TypeScript where applicable
- Vercel configuration and Railway settings properly typed
- Environment variable validation with strict typing

### Real Data Only ✅
- Integration with existing Supabase production database
- Real environment variables and service credentials
- Actual domain DNS configuration and SSL certificates

### Monorepo Architecture ✅
- Maintains existing monorepo structure
- Deploys all three apps (customer, business, admin) to respective platforms
- Preserves shared packages and dependencies

```

**Structure Decision**: Web application (existing monorepo) - extends current structure with deployment configurations

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

Research needed for production deployment setup:

1. **Railway deployment best practices** for Node.js backends
   - Environment variable management and secrets
   - GitHub integration and automatic deployments
   - Staging vs production environment configuration
   - Background job processing setup

2. **Vercel deployment patterns** for Next.js monorepos
   - Monorepo build configuration
   - Environment variable inheritance
   - Custom domain configuration
   - Edge function deployment

3. **Domain and SSL management**
   - DNS configuration for separate domains
   - SSL certificate automation and renewal
   - CDN and edge caching optimization
   - Performance monitoring setup

4. **Backup and monitoring strategies**
   - Supabase backup configuration
   - Railway and Vercel monitoring integration
   - Alerting and uptime monitoring
   - Log aggregation and analysis

**Output**: research.md with deployment platform decisions and configurations

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Deployment configuration data model**:
   - Environment variable schemas
   - Domain configuration structure
   - SSL certificate management
   - Backup and monitoring configurations

2. **API contracts for deployment operations**:
   - Health check endpoints for monitoring
   - Status reporting APIs for deployment tracking
   - Backup validation endpoints
   - Performance metrics collection

3. **Deployment validation tests**:
   - Health check contract tests
   - SSL certificate validation tests
   - Environment variable verification tests
   - Performance benchmark tests

4. **Integration test scenarios**:
   - Full deployment workflow validation
   - Rollback procedure testing
   - Cross-domain functionality testing
   - Backup and recovery testing

5. **Update CLAUDE.md with deployment context**:
   - Add Railway and Vercel deployment procedures
   - Document environment variable management
   - Include rollback and monitoring procedures

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Environment setup tasks for Railway and Vercel
- Domain and SSL configuration tasks
- Database production setup and backup configuration
- Monitoring and alerting implementation tasks
- Deployment automation script creation
- Testing and validation tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Infrastructure setup before application deployment
- Staging environment before production
- Monitoring setup before live deployment
- Backup configuration before data operations

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered deployment tasks in tasks.md

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations identified - all requirements align with established principles*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
