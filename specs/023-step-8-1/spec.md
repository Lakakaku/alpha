# Feature Specification: Production Deployment

**Feature Branch**: `023-step-8-1` **Created**: 2025-09-27 **Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Step 8.1: Production Deployment"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Production deployment setup for Vocilia system
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: DevOps team, system administrators
   � Actions: Deploy backend, deploy frontends, configure domains, setup monitoring
   � Data: Environment variables, SSL certificates, deployment configs
   � Constraints: High availability, security, performance requirements
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � DevOps deployment workflow and validation scenarios
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement focused on deployment capabilities
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   � Deployment configurations, environment variables, monitoring data
7. Run Review Checklist
   � Focus on production readiness requirements
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT deployment capabilities are needed and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no specific deployment scripts, exact configs)
- =e Written for business stakeholders and operations team

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a DevOps engineer, I need to deploy the complete Vocilia system to production
environments so that businesses and customers can access the live customer
feedback reward system with reliable performance, security, and monitoring.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the current development codebase is ready for production, **When**
   deploying the backend to Railway, **Then** the API services are accessible
   with proper environment configuration and monitoring
2. **Given** the Next.js applications are ready for deployment, **When**
   deploying to Vercel, **Then** all three web applications (customer, business,
   admin) are accessible with proper build configurations
3. **Given** the applications are deployed, **When** configuring custom domains,
   **Then** users can access the system via branded URLs with SSL encryption
4. **Given** the production environment is live, **When** monitoring system
   health, **Then** administrators can track performance, errors, and system
   availability

### Edge Cases

- What happens when deployment fails due to environment variable issues? System must provide verification and rollback capabilities
- How does the system handle database connection failures during deployment? System must maintain stable database connectivity during deployments
- What monitoring alerts are triggered during service outages? System must provide immediate alerting for uptime violations
- How are rollbacks handled if deployment introduces critical issues? System must support rapid rollback procedures for failed deployments

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27
- Q: What is the expected traffic volume for sizing production infrastructure? → A: Medium volume: 1,000-10,000 customers/month, 100-500 concurrent users
- Q: What should be the rollback timeframe for failed deployments? → A: Fast: Manual rollback capability within 15 minutes
- Q: What domain structure should be used for the multi-domain setup? → A: Subdomain structure: api.vocilia.com, admin.vocilia.com, business.vocilia.com
- Q: What uptime requirement should the production system meet? → A: Standard: 99.5% uptime (3.5 hours downtime per month)
- Q: What backup frequency should be implemented for the production database? → A: Daily: Automated backups every 24 hours with 30-day retention

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST deploy backend Node.js services to Railway with
  production environment variables (DATABASE_URL, API_KEYS, JWT_SECRET, OPENAI_API_KEY)
- **FR-002**: System MUST deploy three Next.js applications (customer, business,
  admin) to Vercel with build configurations (TypeScript compilation, environment variable injection, optimized bundles)
- **FR-003**: System MUST configure automatic deployments from GitHub
  repositories for continuous delivery
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide staging environments for testing before
  production releases
- **FR-005**: System MUST configure custom domains with SSL certificates for
  user-facing applications
- **FR-006**: System MUST establish secure connection to production Supabase
  database with connection pooling
- **FR-007**: System MUST implement monitoring and logging (health checks, performance metrics, error tracking, uptime monitoring) for production environments to maintain 99.5% uptime (3.5 hours maximum unplanned downtime per month)
- **FR-008**: System MUST configure daily automated backups for database and application configurations with 30-day retention
- **FR-009**: System MUST implement environment-specific configurations for
  development, staging, and production
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide deployment status monitoring and alerting
  capabilities
- **FR-011**: System MUST configure CDN and edge caching for medium-volume traffic (1,000-10,000 customers/month, 100-500 concurrent users) with <2 second page load times
- **FR-012**: System MUST implement background job processing for payment
  batches and AI analysis tasks
- **FR-013**: System MUST establish proper DNS configuration for separate domains: api.vocilia.com (backend), admin.vocilia.com (admin), business.vocilia.com (business)
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide manual rollback capabilities for failed deployments within 15 minutes of issue detection

### Key Entities

- **Deployment Configuration**: Environment-specific settings, API keys,
  database connections
- **Environment Variables**: Production secrets, third-party service
  credentials, feature flags
- **SSL Certificates**: Domain validation, encryption certificates, renewal
  processes
- **Monitoring Data**: Performance metrics, error logs, availability statistics
- **Backup Records**: Database snapshots, configuration backups, recovery
  procedures
