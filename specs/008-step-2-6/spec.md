## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

Business managers need to quickly understand customer feedback trends and
identify actionable insights from their stores. They want to see this week's
feedback categorized into positive/negative sentiment, search for specific
department feedback, and receive automated analysis that highlights new issues
or improvements since last week.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a business manager logs into their dashboard, **When** they
   navigate to feedback analysis, **Then** they see current week's feedback
   automatically categorized into positive, negative, and general opinions with
   summary counts
2. **Given** feedback data exists for the current week, **When** the manager
   views the analysis, **Then** they see new critiques identified compared to
   last week and actionable insights generated by AI
3. **Given** a manager wants department-specific feedback, **When** they search
   for "meat section" or "checkout", **Then** they see only feedback related to
   that department with relevant insights
4. **Given** multiple weeks of feedback exist, **When** the manager uses
   temporal comparison, **Then** they can see week-over-week changes and track
   if previous issues were resolved
5. **Given** the manager needs quick insights, **When** they ask natural
   language questions like "What do customers think about our new bakery?",
   **Then** they receive relevant feedback summaries and analysis

### Edge Cases

- What happens when no feedback exists for the current week?
- How does system handle search queries that return no results?
- What occurs when AI analysis cannot categorize feedback clearly?
- How does temporal comparison work for the first week of operation?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display current week's feedback automatically
  categorized into positive feedback, negative feedback, and general opinions
- **FR-002**: System MUST identify and highlight new critiques that appeared
  since the previous week
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide smart search functionality that allows
  department-specific queries (e.g., "meat section", "checkout")
- **FR-004**: System MUST support natural language queries through a chatbot
  interface for feedback exploration
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate automated weekly analysis reports using AI
  that summarize key insights
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide temporal comparison tools to track
  week-over-week feedback changes
- **FR-007**: System MUST show actionable insights and recommendations based on
  feedback patterns
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow filtering feedback by specific store location
  for multi-store businesses
- **FR-009**: System MUST track and display whether previous issues identified
  in feedback have been resolved
- **FR-010**: System MUST present maximum analysis information by default to
  minimize need for additional queries
- **FR-011**: System MUST identify emerging issues and trends from feedback data
  automatically
- **FR-012**: System MUST aggregate general opinions and present them in an
  easily digestible format

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

  tags, timestamp, and store association
- **Analysis Report**: AI-generated weekly summary containing categorized
  insights, trends, and recommendations
- **Search Query**: User-initiated searches with natural language processing and
  department filtering capabilities
- **Temporal Comparison**: Week-over-week analysis showing changes in feedback
  patterns and issue resolution status
