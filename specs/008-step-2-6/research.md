# Research Phase: Feedback Analysis Dashboard

**Feature**: 008-step-2-6 **Date**: 2025-09-21 **Status**: Complete

## Technical Research Summary

### AI Integration Research

**Decision**: GPT-4o-mini for feedback analysis and natural language processing
**Rationale**:

- Already integrated in the existing Vocilia system for feedback collection
- Proven performance for Swedish language support and sentiment analysis
- Cost-effective for high-volume feedback processing
- Existing infrastructure and API keys available

**Alternatives considered**:

- OpenAI GPT-4: Higher cost, unnecessary complexity for this use case
- Local AI models: Would violate "Production from Day One" principle
- Other cloud AI services: Would require new integrations and authentication

### Frontend Framework Research

**Decision**: Extend existing Next.js 14 apps/business application
**Rationale**:

- Constitutional requirement to use existing monorepo architecture
- Next.js 14 App Router already implemented for business dashboard
- Existing authentication and store context switching in place
- Tailwind CSS styling already standardized

**Alternatives considered**:

- Separate frontend application: Would violate monorepo architecture principle
- Different React framework: Would break existing styling and auth patterns

### Database Integration Research

**Decision**: Extend existing Supabase PostgreSQL schema with feedback analysis
tables **Rationale**:

- Constitutional requirement for real data only with RLS policies
- Existing feedback data structure in place from previous features
- Row Level Security already implemented for multi-tenant isolation
- Real-time subscriptions available for live updates

**Alternatives considered**:

- Separate analytics database: Would require data synchronization complexity
- NoSQL solutions: Would break existing RLS and multi-tenant patterns

### State Management Research

**Decision**: React Server Components with Supabase client-side queries
**Rationale**:

- Leverages Next.js 14 App Router server component benefits
- Existing Supabase client patterns established in business app
- Real-time updates possible with Supabase subscriptions
- Optimistic updates pattern already implemented

**Alternatives considered**:

- Redux/Zustand: Unnecessary complexity for this feature scope
- Server-only queries: Would prevent real-time updates requirement

### Performance Optimization Research

**Decision**: Multi-level caching with background AI processing **Rationale**:

- AI analysis can be pre-computed for current week's data
- Database query caching reduces response times to <200ms target
- Background processing ensures <3s AI response time requirement
- Supabase Edge Functions for serverless AI processing

**Alternatives considered**:

- Real-time AI processing: Would exceed 3s response time constraint
- Client-side AI: Not feasible with GPT-4o-mini API requirements

### Search Implementation Research

**Decision**: Full-text search with PostgreSQL + AI-enhanced query understanding
**Rationale**:

- PostgreSQL full-text search supports department-specific queries
- GPT-4o-mini can parse natural language queries into structured filters
- Existing RLS policies ensure proper data isolation
- Vector similarity search possible for semantic queries

**Alternatives considered**:

- Elasticsearch: Would add infrastructure complexity
- Client-side filtering: Would not scale with feedback volume
- Simple SQL LIKE queries: Insufficient for natural language requirements

## Integration Patterns

### Existing Codebase Integration

- Extends `apps/business/src/app/dashboard/` with new analysis routes
- Uses existing `@vocilia/auth` package for business authentication
- Leverages existing `@vocilia/database` utilities for Supabase operations
- Follows established `@vocilia/types` patterns for TypeScript definitions

### API Patterns

- REST endpoints in `apps/backend/src/routes/feedback-analysis/`
- Follows existing API contract patterns from previous features
- Uses established middleware for authentication and context validation
- Integrates with existing GPT-4o-mini service patterns

### Data Flow Patterns

- Business manager → Frontend dashboard → Backend API → Supabase + GPT-4o-mini
- Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions for analysis status
- Background processing for weekly report generation
- Cached results for improved performance

## Dependencies Validation

### Required Libraries (already available)

- `@supabase/supabase-js`: Database client
- `openai`: GPT-4o-mini API integration
- `next`: Framework for frontend
- `tailwindcss`: Styling framework
- `typescript`: Language requirement

### New Dependencies (minimal additions)

- None required - all functionality achievable with existing stack

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Metrics (from Technical Context)

- AI response time: <3s (achievable with caching and background processing)
- Feedback categorization: <2s (PostgreSQL queries with proper indexing)
- Database queries: <200ms (existing Supabase performance patterns)

### Scalability Considerations

- Feedback volume: Thousands of records (well within PostgreSQL capabilities)
- Concurrent users: Multi-store businesses (handled by existing RLS and auth)
- Real-time updates: Supabase subscriptions support required concurrency

## Research Conclusions

All technical requirements can be satisfied using the existing Vocilia
technology stack without introducing new dependencies or architectural changes.
The implementation follows established patterns and maintains constitutional
compliance throughout.
