## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-24

- Q: When multiple trigger conditions apply simultaneously, what strategy should
  the system use to handle trigger conflicts? → A: Apply trigger priority
  hierarchy - higher priority triggers override lower ones
- Q: What should be the priority weighting scale for question importance to
  ensure proper prioritization when call time is limited? → A: 5-level scale:
  Critical (5), High (4), Medium (3), Low (2), Optional (1)
- Q: When customer purchase data is incomplete or unclear, how should the system
  handle question triggering? → A: Ask customer for missing purchase details
  during verification
- Q: What sensitivity range should businesses use to configure trigger
  thresholds for different conditions? → A: Flexible range: 1-100 customers with
  business choosing exact numbers
- Q: How should the system handle timing conflicts between different question
  schedules? → A: Business configures conflict resolution per question pair

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

**As a business owner**, I want an intelligent question system that
automatically combines and triggers relevant questions based on customer
purchase behavior, store context, and timing constraints, so that I can collect
maximum valuable feedback within the 1-2 minute call limit without overwhelming
customers.

**As a customer**, I want to receive questions that are relevant to my specific
shopping experience and purchase, so that I can provide meaningful feedback
efficiently without answering irrelevant questions.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a customer purchased items from meat section and bakery, **When**
   they complete verification, **Then** system combines meat quality and bakery
   freshness questions for their call
2. **Given** it's lunch hour (11:30-13:30), **When** a customer verifies,
   **Then** system automatically includes queue time and checkout experience
   questions
3. **Given** a customer spent over 500 SEK, **When** verification is complete,
   **Then** system triggers value perception and service quality questions
4. **Given** multiple questions are scheduled for the same customer, **When**
   call begins, **Then** system prioritizes by importance and groups related
   topics to fit 1-2 minute duration
5. **Given** customer frequency rules conflict (every 3rd vs every 5th),
   **When** customer qualifies for both, **Then** system harmonizes to ask both
   sets appropriately
6. **Given** high priority questions need to be asked, **When** call time is
   limited, **Then** system prioritizes important questions over routine ones

### Edge Cases

- When multiple trigger conditions apply simultaneously, system applies trigger
  priority hierarchy where higher priority triggers override lower ones
- System handles timing conflicts between different question schedules through
  business-configurable conflict resolution settings per question pair
- When customer purchase data is incomplete or unclear, system asks customer for
  missing purchase details during verification to enable proper question
  triggering
- When call duration approaches maximum limit (90% of allocated time), system
  automatically switches to high-priority questions only, truncates remaining
  low-priority questions gracefully, and ensures critical questions are
  completed before call termination.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Question Combination Engine

- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically combine compatible questions for each
  customer call to maximize information gathering efficiency
- **FR-002**: System MUST ensure combined questions fit within 1-2 minute call
  duration constraint through time optimization algorithms
- **FR-003**: System MUST group questions by topic relevance to create natural
  conversation flow
- **FR-004**: System MUST apply priority weighting to ensure high-importance
  questions are asked when time is limited
- **FR-005**: System MUST harmonize different question frequencies through
  business-configurable conflict resolution settings per question pair to avoid
  customer fatigue while maintaining data collection goals

#### Dynamic Trigger System

- **FR-006**: System MUST automatically trigger specific questions based on
  customer purchase categories and items, requesting missing purchase details
  during verification when data is incomplete
- **FR-007**: System MUST activate time-sensitive questions based on purchase
  timing (lunch hour, evening, weekend)
- **FR-008**: System MUST trigger value-based questions when customer
  transaction amount exceeds defined thresholds
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle complex trigger combinations by applying
  trigger priority hierarchy where higher priority triggers override lower ones
  when multiple conditions are met simultaneously
- **FR-010**: System MUST track trigger effectiveness and adjust activation
  rules based on feedback quality

#### System Integration

- **FR-011**: System MUST integrate with existing context window configuration
  to respect business-defined question settings
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain audit trail of which questions were asked to
  which customers for analytics
- **FR-013**: System MUST preserve existing question frequency settings while
  optimizing combinations
- **FR-014**: System MUST ensure trigger logic doesn't conflict with fraud
  detection mechanisms

#### Performance & User Experience

- **FR-015**: System MUST process question combinations in real-time during
  customer verification flow
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide businesses with visibility into how questions
  are being combined and triggered
- **FR-017**: System MUST allow businesses to configure trigger sensitivity
  levels using flexible range of 1-100 customers with business choosing exact
  numbers for each trigger condition
- **FR-018**: System MUST maintain call quality by ensuring logical question
  flow and avoiding repetitive topics

### Key Entities

- **Question Combination Rule**: Defines how multiple questions can be grouped
  together, including time constraints, topic relationships, and priority
  hierarchies
- **Dynamic Trigger**: Conditions that automatically activate specific questions
  based on purchase data, timing, or transaction values
- **Priority Weight**: 5-level numerical scoring system (Critical=5, High=4,
  Medium=3, Low=2, Optional=1) that determines question importance when time
  constraints require selection
- **Frequency Harmonizer**: Business-configurable logic that resolves conflicts
  between different question scheduling frequencies through per-question-pair
  resolution settings
- **Trigger Activation Log**: Record of which triggers fired for each customer
  interaction for analytics and optimization
- **Question Group**: Collection of related questions that work well together in
  conversation flow
- **Time Constraint Optimizer**: Algorithm that calculates optimal question
  combinations within call duration limits
