# QR Code Management System - Research Findings

**Date**: 2025-09-20  
**Feature**: QR Code Management System (004-step-2-2)

## Executive Summary

Research conducted on existing Vocilia Alpha codebase and industry best practices for QR code generation, PDF creation, analytics aggregation, and bulk operations. All technical unknowns resolved with production-ready decisions aligned with constitutional requirements.

## Research Areas & Decisions

### 1. QR Code Generation Library Selection

**Decision**: Use `qrcode` npm package (v1.5.x) for server-side generation and `react-qr-code` (v2.0.x) for client-side display

**Rationale**:
- `qrcode` is the most mature and widely-used Node.js QR generation library
- Supports multiple output formats (SVG, PNG, terminal, data URL)
- Zero dependencies and excellent TypeScript support
- `react-qr-code` provides clean React component integration
- Both libraries are actively maintained with 50M+ weekly downloads

**Alternatives Considered**:
- `qr-image`: Older, less flexible output options
- `node-qrcode`: Abandoned project
- `qrcode-generator`: Browser-only, no Node.js support

### 2. PDF Generation Strategy

**Decision**: Use `jspdf` (v2.5.x) with `canvas` (v2.11.x) for server-side PDF template generation

**Rationale**:
- `jspdf` provides comprehensive PDF creation capabilities
- Integrates well with QR code canvas output from `qrcode` library
- Supports custom fonts, images, and precise layout control
- Existing Vocilia stores have branding requirements (logo, colors, text)
- Client-side generation reduces server load for download operations

**Alternatives Considered**:
- `puppeteer`: Overkill for simple PDF templates, larger dependencies
- `pdfkit`: More complex API, less browser compatibility
- Server-only generation: Would increase API load and response times

### 3. Analytics Aggregation Architecture

**Decision**: 5-minute batch aggregation with real-time event streaming for live updates

**Rationale**:
- Aligns with existing session management patterns (immediate `last_activity` updates)
- Balances real-time user experience with database performance
- Supports existing Supabase real-time subscriptions infrastructure
- Enables efficient trend analysis without overwhelming the database
- Meets performance goals (<200ms response times)

**Implementation Pattern**:
```sql
-- Raw events table for real-time inserts
qr_scan_events (store_id, scanned_at, user_agent, referrer)

-- Aggregated analytics table updated every 5 minutes
qr_analytics_hourly (store_id, hour_bucket, scan_count, unique_sources)
qr_analytics_daily (store_id, date_bucket, scan_count, peak_hour)
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Real-time aggregation: Would impact database performance at scale
- Hourly batches: Too slow for business dashboard expectations
- Event sourcing: Overcomplicated for current scale requirements

### 4. Bulk Operations Pattern

**Decision**: Use React Query mutations with optimistic updates and batch API calls

**Rationale**:
- Existing codebase uses similar patterns for store context switching
- Provides immediate UI feedback while processing server-side
- Supports rollback on failures with built-in error handling
- Integrates with existing permission system (`canManageQR()` per store)
- Scales to 50+ stores per business requirement

**Implementation Pattern**:
```typescript
// Batch API call
POST /api/qr/bulk/regenerate
{
  storeIds: string[],
  operation: 'regenerate' | 'activate' | 'deactivate'
}

// Frontend optimistic updates
const { mutate } = useMutation({
  mutationFn: bulkRegenerateQR,
  onMutate: optimisticUpdate,
  onError: rollbackUpdate
})
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Individual API calls: Would create UI lag and race conditions
- Server-side job queue: Overcomplicated for current scale
- WebSocket real-time updates: Not needed for infrequent bulk operations

### 5. QR Code Transition Strategy

**Decision**: 24-hour grace period with timestamp-based versioning

**Rationale**:
- Based on existing regeneration pattern using timestamp parameters
- Provides sufficient time for businesses to replace physical QR codes
- Store ID remains constant, ensuring continuity during transition
- Follows existing database trigger pattern for QR URL generation
- Supports audit trail for compliance and debugging

**Implementation Details**:
```sql
-- Current: stores.qr_code_data = "https://customer.vocilia.se/entry/store/{id}"
-- New: stores.qr_code_data = "https://customer.vocilia.se/entry/store/{id}?t={timestamp}"
-- Both resolve to same store_id for 24 hours
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Immediate cutover: Risk of broken QR codes in physical locations
- Indefinite support: Database bloat and confusion
- UUID-based versioning: Would break existing URL pattern

### 6. Print Template Customization

**Decision**: Configurable PDF templates with store info, business branding, and size options

**Rationale**:
- Businesses need QR codes with their branding for professional appearance
- Multiple size options (A4, letter, labels) support different printing needs
- Store-specific information helps customers identify correct location
- Matches existing business context window customization patterns

**Template Elements**:
- QR code (center, scalable)
- Store name and address
- Business logo (if provided)
- "Scan for feedback" call-to-action text
- Vocilia branding (footer)
- Multiple sizes: A4 poster, business card, label sheet

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Fixed templates: Lacks professional customization businesses expect
- Full design editor: Overcomplicated for QR code use case
- Image-only output: PDF provides better print quality and sizing

### 7. Scan Analytics Update Frequency

**Decision**: 5-minute batch updates with WebSocket events for real-time notifications

**Rationale**:
- Provides near-real-time experience without database overload
- Supports existing Supabase real-time subscription infrastructure
- Enables trend analysis with hourly/daily/weekly aggregations
- Meets business dashboard expectations for timely updates
- Allows efficient indexing and query optimization

**Update Schedule**:
- Real-time: Individual scan events via WebSocket
- 5-minute: Aggregate scan counts per store
- Hourly: Peak usage analysis and trends
- Daily: Historical analytics and reporting

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Real-time updates: Database performance impact at scale
- 15-minute intervals: Too slow for business engagement
- Database triggers: Would impact scan response times

## Technical Architecture Summary

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- QR scan tracking
qr_scan_events (id, store_id, scanned_at, user_agent, referrer)

-- Analytics aggregations  
qr_analytics_5min (store_id, time_bucket, scan_count)
qr_analytics_hourly (store_id, hour_bucket, scan_count, peak_5min)
qr_analytics_daily (store_id, date_bucket, scan_count, peak_hour)

-- QR code history
qr_code_history (id, store_id, old_qr_data, new_qr_data, changed_at, reason)
```

### API Architecture
```
Backend Services (Railway):
- QR Generation Service: Node.js + qrcode library
- PDF Template Service: jspdf + canvas rendering
- Analytics Aggregation: 5-minute cron jobs
- Scan Tracking API: Real-time event collection

Frontend Components (Vercel):
- QR Display Component: react-qr-code
- Management Dashboard: React Query + optimistic updates
- Bulk Operations UI: Multi-store selection with progress
- Analytics Charts: Real-time WebSocket updates
```

### Integration Points
- Extends existing store management system
- Uses current permission framework (`canManageQR`)
- Integrates with business context switching
- Follows established RLS policy patterns
- Maintains audit trails per constitutional requirements

## Performance Considerations

- QR generation: <200ms server response time
- PDF downloads: <2MB file size, client-side generation
- Analytics queries: Indexed aggregation tables
- Bulk operations: Batch API calls with progress tracking
- Real-time updates: WebSocket for scan notifications only

## Security Compliance

- RLS policies for multi-tenant QR access
- No customer personal data in QR analytics
- Audit trails for all QR changes
- Secure PDF generation without data exposure
- Rate limiting for scan tracking API
