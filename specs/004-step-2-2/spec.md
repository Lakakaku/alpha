**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "### Step 2.2: QR Code Management System
- [ ] **Task 2.2.1**: QR code generation
  - Implement unique QR code generation per store
  - Create QR code display and download interface
  - Set up QR code regeneration functionality
  - Design printable QR code formats
- [ ] **Task 2.2.2**: QR code management dashboard

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors (businesses, stores), actions (generate, display, download, regenerate, monitor, analyze, replace, bulk manage), data (QR codes, scans, analytics), constraints (unique per store, printable formats)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a business owner with one or multiple physical stores, I need to generate, manage, and track QR codes that customers scan to provide feedback. Each store needs its own unique QR code that can be printed and displayed in the physical location. I need to monitor how often codes are scanned and be able to regenerate or replace them when necessary.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a business has been approved and has a store registered, **When** they access the QR code management section, **Then** they should see a unique QR code generated for their store
2. **Given** a business has a QR code for their store, **When** they select download/print options, **Then** they receive the QR code in multiple printable formats suitable for physical display
3. **Given** a QR code has been compromised or needs updating, **When** the business initiates regeneration, **Then** a new unique QR code is created while maintaining historical analytics
4. **Given** a business has multiple store locations, **When** they access QR management, **Then** they can view, manage, and perform bulk operations on all their stores' QR codes
5. **Given** QR codes are being used by customers, **When** a business views analytics, **Then** they see scan counts, usage patterns, and trends for each QR code
6. **Given** a QR code needs to be replaced (damaged, lost, etc.), **When** the business initiates replacement, **Then** they can generate a new version while tracking the replacement history

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a business tries to generate a QR code for a store that already has one?
- How does the system handle QR code generation for stores pending verification?
- What occurs if a business attempts to download a QR code while it's being regenerated?
- How does the system manage QR codes for deactivated or closed stores?
- What happens when bulk operations are performed on a mix of active and inactive stores?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST generate a unique QR code for each individual store location
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow businesses to download QR codes in multiple printable formats pdf.
- **FR-003**: System MUST display QR codes with accompanying store information for easy identification
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to regenerate QR codes while preserving analytics history
- **FR-005**: System MUST track and display scan analytics for each QR code including total scans and usage patterns over time
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a replacement workflow that maintains continuity between old and new QR codes
- **FR-007**: System MUST support bulk operations for businesses with multiple locations
- **FR-008**: System MUST show QR code status (active, inactive, pending) for each store
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide printable templates with QR codes and customizable business information, text should be customizable.
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain QR code generation and replacement history with timestamps
- **FR-011**: System MUST ensure QR codes remain functional during replacement transition periods. This is unclear, but do research in the codebase about it and find its context.
- **FR-012**: System MUST display real-time or near-real-time scan analytics. Find the most reasonable time interval.
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow filtering and sorting of QR codes for multi-location businesses
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide usage trend analysis showing scan patterns over different time periods. Monthly, weekely, daily, hourly.
- **FR-015**: System MUST link each QR code to its corresponding store's feedback collection system

### Key Entities
- **QR Code**: Unique identifier for customer entry point, linked to specific store, includes generation date, status, scan count, and visual representation
- **Store**: Physical business location that owns a QR code, includes store details, verification status, and active QR code reference
- **QR Analytics**: Scan tracking data including timestamp, frequency, patterns, and usage trends per QR code
- **QR History**: Audit trail of QR code generation, regeneration, and replacement events with reasons and timestamps
- **Print Template**: Downloadable format options for QR codes including various sizes and accompanying business information

## Notes for Planning Phase

Several aspects require clarification before implementation:
1. **Print formats**: Specific file formats and size options for QR code downloads
2. **Template customization**: What business information and branding can be included
3. **Analytics update frequency**: Real-time vs periodic updates for scan tracking
4. **Time periods for trends**: Daily, weekly, monthly analytics views
5. **Transition grace period**: How long old QR codes remain active after replacement

These clarifications should be addressed during the planning phase to ensure accurate implementation.
