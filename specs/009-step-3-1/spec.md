# Feature Specification: QR Code Landing & Verification System

**Feature Branch**: `009-step-3-1` **Created**: 2025-09-22 **Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "### Step 3.1: QR Code Landing & Verification

- [ ] **Task 3.1.1**: QR code scan handling
  - Create QR code scan landing page
  - Implement store identification from QR data
  - Set up mobile-optimized interface
  - Build error handling for invalid codes
- [ ] **Task 3.1.2**: Customer verification process
  - Create transaction time input (¬±2 min tolerance)
  - Build transaction value input (¬±2 SEK tolerance)
  - Implement phone number input and validation
  - Set up verification form submission ---- here is some overall context about
    the project: '/Users/lucasjenner/alpha/VISION.md'"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí COMPLETED: QR code landing and customer verification flow identified
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí COMPLETED: actors (customers), actions (scan, verify), data (store ID, transaction details, phone), constraints (time/value tolerance)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All aspects clearly defined in VISION.md context
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí COMPLETED: Clear user flow from QR scan to verification submission
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí COMPLETED: All requirements testable and unambiguous
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí COMPLETED: Store, Customer, Transaction, QR Code entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: No ambiguities, no implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

A customer finishes shopping at a physical store, notices a QR code display
encouraging feedback, scans it with their phone, and is taken to a
mobile-optimized landing page where they verify their recent transaction details
(time, amount, phone number) to qualify for AI-powered feedback collection and
potential cashback rewards.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a customer has just completed a purchase, **When** they scan the
   store's QR code, **Then** they should be directed to a mobile-optimized
   landing page showing the store's identity and verification form
2. **Given** a customer is on the verification page, **When** they enter
   transaction time within ¬±2 minutes of actual purchase time, **Then** the
   system should accept the time as valid
3. **Given** a customer enters transaction value within ¬±2 SEK of actual amount,
   **When** they submit the form, **Then** the system should proceed to phone
   number validation
4. **Given** a customer enters a valid Swedish phone number, **When** they
   submit the complete verification form, **Then** the system should confirm
   submission and prepare for the AI feedback call process
5. **Given** a customer scans an invalid or corrupted QR code, **When** the
   system attempts to process it, **Then** they should see a clear error message
   explaining the issue

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a customer enters a transaction time more than 2 minutes
  different from current time? Then, when the store/businesses verifies its
  feedbacks, the customer will get dis-verified, since they cannot be verified
  with that time-diff.
- How does the system handle transaction values that differ by more than 2 SEK
  from reasonable purchase amounts? Then, when the store/businesses verifies its
  feedbacks, the customer will get dis-verified, since they cannot be verified
  with that money-diff
- What happens if a customer enters an invalid phone number format? We cannot
  pay them (since we will use "Swish" which basically sends money to telephone
  number's)
- How does the system respond to completely corrupted or unreadable QR codes? Do
  not use then?
- What happens if a customer tries to access the landing page without scanning a
  QR code? I do not know, I think we should now allow that right for security
  reasons?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST extract store identification data from scanned QR
  codes to display correct store information
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a mobile-optimized landing page that displays
  clearly on all smartphone screen sizes
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate transaction time input with ¬±2 minute
  tolerance from current time
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate transaction value input with ¬±2 SEK tolerance
  from reasonable purchase amounts
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate Swedish phone number format and accept only
  valid numbers
- **FR-006**: System MUST display clear error messages for invalid QR codes that
  cannot be processed
- **FR-007**: System MUST show store identity (name/logo) on the landing page
  based on QR code data
- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent form submission until all required fields
  (time, amount, phone) are properly filled
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide immediate feedback when verification form is
  successfully submitted
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle cases where customers access the page without
  valid QR code data

### Key Entities

- **Store**: Represents individual business locations with unique identifiers,
  names, and associated QR codes
- **QR Code**: Contains encoded store identification data that links to specific
  business locations
- **Transaction**: Customer purchase event with timestamp, monetary value, and
  associated store location
- **Customer Verification**: Form submission containing transaction time,
  amount, and phone number for validation
- **Verification Session**: Complete customer interaction from QR scan through
  successful form submission
