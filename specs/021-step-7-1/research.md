# Research: Comprehensive Testing System

**Date**: 2025-09-26
**Feature**: Step 7.1 Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure

## Testing Framework Decisions

### Decision: Jest for Unit and Integration Testing
**Rationale**:
- Already integrated into existing TypeScript monorepo
- Excellent TypeScript support with ts-jest
- Mature ecosystem for mocking Supabase clients and API endpoints
- Native support for async/await patterns used throughout codebase
- Built-in coverage reporting aligns with risk-based coverage requirements

**Alternatives considered**:
- Vitest: Faster but requires migration from existing Jest setup
- Mocha/Chai: More configuration overhead, less TypeScript-friendly

### Decision: Playwright for End-to-End Testing
**Rationale**:
- Best-in-class mobile browser testing for PWA requirements
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) for customer app
- Built-in screenshot and video recording for test debugging
- Strong TypeScript support and auto-waiting reduces flaky tests
- Can test QR code scanning workflows with device simulation

**Alternatives considered**:
- Cypress: Less mobile-focused, heavier resource usage
- Puppeteer: Chrome-only, more manual setup required

### Decision: Artillery for Performance/Load Testing
**Rationale**:
- YAML configuration aligns with existing deployment configs
- Excellent HTTP/WebSocket testing for AI call simulation
- Built-in metrics collection and reporting
- Can simulate realistic user journeys (QR scan → AI call → payment)
- Lightweight and integrates well with CI/CD pipelines

**Alternatives considered**:
- K6: JavaScript-based but adds language complexity
- JMeter: GUI-based, harder to version control and automate

## Test Data Strategy

### Decision: Faker.js + Custom Generators for Synthetic Data
**Rationale**:
- Generates realistic Swedish phone numbers, names, addresses
- Consistent reproducible test data with seed values
- No privacy concerns with customer data
- Custom generators for business context (store types, feedback patterns)
- Integrates with existing TypeScript validation schemas

**Alternatives considered**:
- Production data snapshots: Privacy and compliance risks
- Manually curated datasets: Maintenance overhead, limited scenarios

## CI/CD Integration Strategy

### Decision: GitHub Actions with Railway/Vercel Integration
**Rationale**:
- Already configured for existing deployment pipeline
- Can run tests on every commit as required
- Native integration with Vercel preview deployments for E2E testing
- Railway CLI supports database migration testing
- Parallel test execution for faster feedback

**Alternatives considered**:
- Railway-only CI: Limited test execution environment options
- Vercel-only CI: No backend testing capabilities

## Test Environment Strategy

### Decision: Branch Databases + Preview Deployments
**Rationale**:
- Supabase supports branch databases for isolated testing
- Vercel preview deployments provide realistic frontend testing
- Railway review apps enable full-stack integration testing
- Matches existing development workflow

**Alternatives considered**:
- Local testing only: Doesn't validate deployment pipeline
- Shared test database: Concurrency and isolation issues

## Performance Testing Approach

### Decision: Lighthouse CI + Artillery Integration
**Rationale**:
- Lighthouse CI validates PWA performance requirements (<3s page loads)
- Artillery validates API performance requirements (<1s responses)
- Both integrate with existing Vercel/Railway deployment pipeline
- Measurable performance budgets prevent regression

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual performance testing: Not scalable for every commit
- Single tool approach: Doesn't cover both frontend and backend adequately

## Test Organization Strategy

### Decision: Co-located Test Files + Dedicated Test Directories
**Rationale**:
- Unit tests co-located with source files for easy maintenance
- Integration tests in dedicated `/tests/integration/` directories
- Contract tests in `/tests/contract/` following existing patterns
- E2E tests in `/tests/e2e/` with page object models

**Alternatives considered**:
- All tests in single directory: Harder navigation and organization
- Only co-located tests: Integration and E2E tests don't fit pattern

## Security Testing Integration

### Decision: Jest + Supabase RLS Policy Testing
**Rationale**:
- Tests validate existing RLS policies work correctly
- Authentication flow testing with real Supabase auth
- No additional security tools needed, leverages existing infrastructure
- Tests run against real security policies in branch databases

**Alternatives considered**:
- Dedicated security testing tools: Adds complexity and maintenance overhead
- Manual security testing: Not scalable and error-prone
