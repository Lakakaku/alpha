# Feature Specification: Comprehensive Testing System

**Feature Branch**: `021-step-7-1` **Created**: 2025-09-26 **Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Step 7.1: Comprehensive Testing - Task 7.1.1: Unit
testing implementation (Create component test suites, Build API endpoint
testing, Implement database function testing, Set up utility function testing) -
Task 7.1.2: Integration testing (Create end-to-end user flows, Build API
integration testing, Implement database integration testing, Set up AI service
integration testing) - Task 7.1.3: Performance testing (Create load testing
scenarios, Build database performance testing, Implement API response time
testing, Set up mobile performance optimization)"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Testing requirements identified across three layers
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: unit testing, integration testing, performance testing
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Clear testing flows for all system components
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26

- Q: What specific performance targets should the system meet for response
  times? → A: API responses under 1s, page loads under 3s
- Q: What level of test coverage should be required for the testing system? → A:
  Coverage determined by risk assessment
- Q: How should test failures be prioritized and handled? → A: Block all
  deployments on any test failure
- Q: What test data strategy should be used for comprehensive testing? → A:
  Synthetic test data generators
- Q: What automated testing frequency should be enforced? → A: Tests run on
  every commit

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a development team, we need comprehensive testing coverage across all system
components to ensure the customer feedback reward system operates reliably in
production, handles edge cases gracefully, and performs optimally under various
load conditions.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new feature is developed, **When** unit tests are executed,
   **Then** all individual components function correctly in isolation
2. **Given** system components are integrated, **When** integration tests are
   run, **Then** all components work together seamlessly
3. **Given** the system is under production load, **When** performance tests are
   executed, **Then** response times meet acceptable thresholds
4. **Given** a critical bug occurs, **When** tests are run, **Then** the issue
   is detected and deployment is blocked
5. **Given** code changes are committed, **When** automated tests execute on
   every commit, **Then** regression issues are identified immediately

### Edge Cases

- What happens when AI services are temporarily unavailable during feedback
  calls? Don't have any feedback calls at those times.
- How does the system handle database connection failures during payment
  processing? Fix the issues, be offline for customers until fixed.
- What occurs when mobile devices have poor network connectivity during QR
  scanning? If they have bad enough, do not let them talk to our AI.
- How does the system respond to extremely high concurrent user loads? I do not
  know, find the very best solution.
- What happens when Swish payment service returns unexpected error codes? let
  the admin know, and make describe the problem.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST validate all individual components function correctly
  through comprehensive unit testing with coverage levels determined by risk
  assessment
- **FR-002**: System MUST verify end-to-end user workflows through integration
  testing
- **FR-003**: System MUST ensure performance standards are met through load and
  stress testing
- **FR-004**: Tests MUST cover all critical user paths including QR scanning,
  feedback calls, and payment processing
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate API endpoints respond correctly under various
  input conditions
- **FR-006**: Database operations MUST be tested for data integrity and
  transaction reliability
- **FR-007**: AI service integrations MUST be tested for proper error handling
  and response processing
- **FR-008**: Mobile performance MUST be optimized and validated across
  different device capabilities
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain API response times under 1 second and page
  load times under 3 seconds
- **FR-010**: Payment processing MUST be tested for accuracy and security
  compliance
- **FR-011**: QR code generation and scanning MUST be validated across various
  scenarios
- **FR-012**: Admin dashboard operations MUST be tested for security and
  functionality

  relevance
- **FR-014**: Feedback analysis and grading MUST be tested for consistency and
  fraud detection
