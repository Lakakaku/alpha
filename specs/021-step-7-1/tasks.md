# Tasks: Comprehensive Testing System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/021-step-7-1/` **Prerequisites**:
plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✓
   → Extract: TypeScript 5.0+, Node.js 18+, Jest, Playwright, Artillery, existing monorepo
2. Load optional design documents ✓:
   → data-model.md: TestSuite, TestRun, TestResult, PerformanceBenchmark entities
   → contracts/: test-management-api.yml, test-suites.contract.ts, test-runs.contract.ts
   → research.md: Jest, Playwright, Artillery, Faker.js decisions
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Jest, Playwright, Artillery configuration
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, API endpoints
   → Integration: test execution, reporting
   → Polish: performance optimization, CI/CD integration
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Validate: All contracts tested, all entities modeled
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web app monorepo**: `apps/backend/src/`, `apps/customer/src/`,
  `apps/business/src/`, `apps/admin/src/`
- **Shared packages**: `packages/types/src/`, `packages/database/src/`
- **Tests**: `tests/` at repository root, `apps/*/tests/` for app-specific tests

## Dependencies

### Sequential Dependencies:

- T001-T005 (Setup) must complete before all other phases
- T009-T011 (Types) before T012-T019 (Models)
- T020-T032 (Contract Tests) before T033-T051 (Implementation)
- T033-T038 (Services) before T039-T051 (API Routes)
- T052-T057 (Test Infrastructure) before T058-T062 (Integration Tests)
- T088-T090 (Database) before any database-dependent tests

### File-level Dependencies:

- Same file tasks must run sequentially (no [P])
- T039-T042 (test-suites.ts) - sequential
- T043-T047 (test-runs.ts) - sequential
- T081 blocks other admin testing routes

## Validation Checklist

**GATE: Checked before marking feature complete**

- [ ] All API contracts have corresponding tests (T020-T032 cover all endpoints
      from OpenAPI spec)
- [ ] All data model entities have models (T012-T018 cover all entities from
      data-model.md)
- [ ] All tests come before implementation (T020-T032 before T033-T051)
- [ ] Parallel tasks are truly independent (different files, no shared
      dependencies)
- [ ] Each task specifies exact file path
- [ ] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Quickstart scenarios are validated (T095)
- [ ] Constitutional requirements met (TypeScript strict, production-ready, real
      data)

## Testing Coverage Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: ≥85% coverage for core components
- **Integration Tests**: All service interactions validated
- **E2E Tests**: Critical user journeys covered
- **Performance Tests**: <1s API, <3s page loads
- **Contract Tests**: All API endpoints validated

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- Verify contract tests fail before implementing APIs
- Use synthetic Swedish test data throughout
- Commit after each task completion
- Integrate with existing Railway/Vercel/Supabase infrastructure
- Follow TDD principles: Red → Green → Refactor
