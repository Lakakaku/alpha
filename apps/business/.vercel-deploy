# Vercel Deployment Trigger
# This file triggers deployment with the updated build configuration
# Updated: 2025-09-30

Build configuration has been updated to use:
- pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
- pnpm build with proper dependency filters
- Dependencies built in correct order: types, database, ui, business

Previous deployments failed due to incorrect sequential build commands.
New configuration matches the working customer app setup.
